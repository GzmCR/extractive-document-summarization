Wye Plantation 10-19 (AFP) - It was learned from informed Palestinian sources that American President Bill Clinton indicated during the meeting he held yesterday evening, Sunday, with the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, that it is possible to extend the proceedings of the Wye Plantation summit for a period of two, and possibly three days, in order to exert additional efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement.   

These sources told Agence France Presse that Clinton pointed to this possibility after the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat rejected an Israeli proposal to conclude a partial agreement in return for a security accord.  

They explained that President Arafat affirmed his determination to reach a comprehensive agreement and that Clinton promised him to make additional efforts in order to overcome the obstacles that hinder such an agreement.
