Washington 10-21 (AFP) - Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's Advisor Ahmad Al-Taibi said that today, Wednesday, "will be a critical day" to determine the outcome of the Wye Plantation (Maryland) summit that has been on-going since last Thursday.

Al-Taibi told Agence France, "Today will be critical because it will determine whether or not an agreement will be reached."
 
Al-Taibi explained, "The road is open for an agreement, but the outcome depends on the answers to be presented by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."

The White House reported today that no agreement has been reached yet.
