Wye Mills (Maryland) 10-15 (AFP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat began at Wye Plantation (Maryland) today, Thursday, a four-day meeting under the auspices of the United States in an attempt to revive the peace process in the Middle East.   

American President Bill Clinton officially opened the summit proceedings by noting that "there is a very difficult task that we have to undertake if we want to reach an agreement that advances the peace process and one that we need little time to make." He reaffirmed that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and he personally "will do all they can" in order to reach an agreement.

He explained that the three delegations promised to limit their contacts with reporters to "periodic meetings" in order to "concentrate their energies" on the issues that require a solution.
