Baku 10-13 (AFP) - An official of the Central Election Commission told Agence France Presse on Tuesday that the Security and Cooperation Organization's denunciations of the rigging and irregularities in the first round of presidential elections in Azerbaijan do not have an effect on voting results.
 
Mazaghir Panahov, Public Relations Director of the Commission, said that "the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe can not influence the elections results (...). The legitimacy of the voting is determined by the country where elections are held."

The Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe and Europe's Congress, which deploy 150 observers in the central Asian country that has a population of 7.5 million people, severely criticized yesterday, Monday, the election process as being non-compliant with international norms of democracy. They declared that they noticed the addition of a number of voting cards in the boxes and the media bias toward President Heydar Aliyev, whose term is expiring, during the election campaign.

The Election Commission began this morning, Tuesday, the tallying of votes after two days of the elections, which had a turnout rate of 77.9%.  The Commission announced that the results would not be available before evening.

Aliyev's supporters had proclaimed his win yesterday, Monday, at a rate of 75-80 percent of votes, which was denied by the opposition who asserted that its candidate, Etibar Mammadov, won enough votes to qualify him to go into the second round of the elections.
 
A candidate must win at least two-thirds of the votes (more than 67 percent) to win in the first round of the elections.
