Baku 9-11 (AFP) - Polling boxes closed in Azerbaijan at 20:00 local time this evening, Sunday, after a long day that witnessed a heavy turnout in the first round of the presidential elections following the opening of offices at 07:00 local time (2:00 GMT).
 
The Central Elections Commission in this small Caucasian republic estimated that the percentage of participation reached 66.4% at 18:00, out of a total number of 4.21 million voters.

President Heydar Aliyev faces five candidates from the opposition, including his main opponent Etibar Mammadov (National Independence Party), and was considered the favorite to win the elections, which will lead him to a second term.  In order to accomplish victory from the first round, Aliyev must obtain at least two-thirds of the votes, as was the case in 1993.
