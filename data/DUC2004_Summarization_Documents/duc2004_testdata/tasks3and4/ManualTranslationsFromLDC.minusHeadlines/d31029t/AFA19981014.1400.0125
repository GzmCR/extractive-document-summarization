Baku 10-14 (AFP) - An official in the Central Election Commission announced today, Wednesday, that Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev has won the presidential election, which was held last weekend, by obtaining 75 percent of the votes.

The official, who refused to reveal his name, said that "tallying of the votes is still continuing, but we can preliminarily declare that President Heydar Aliyev won by obtaining 75 percent of the votes."

Aliyev had proclaimed his win yesterday, Tuesday, asserting that he received the specified percentage, but his main rival demanded a second round, citing the many irregularities that were reported by international observers.
 
A candidate must obtain at least two-thirds of the votes to be able to win in the first round.
