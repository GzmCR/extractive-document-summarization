London 12-30 (AFP) - One of the surviving hostages in Yemen, David Holmes, 
announced in a telephone call conducted with him from London by Agence France Presse that the hostages who died Tuesday in Yemen at the hands of their kidnappers were killed during the attack by policemen, and not before the attack as Yemeni police asserted.

Holmes (64 years), who is still in Aden, regarded "that all reports that said that the criminals attacked the hostages (before the raid by security forces) do not agree with the developments of events. When the criminals found themselves threatened and realized that they may be defeated, they wanted to kill the hostages."

Aden's Security Chief, Brigadier General Mohammad Saleh Tareeq, had announced today, Wednesday, in the presence of some survivors who refused to speak to the press that "the hostage rescue operation started after the gang began killing the hostages, whereas they first killed three of the British hostages, which then forced the security forces to storm their location to prevent more bloodshed, and was consequently able to free the rest of the hostages."

This story contradicts with Holmes' story, who explained that he saw Margaret Whitehouse get killed after the attack started.
 
Holmes, while in shock, added, "Bullets were pouring over my head (...), and I saw a soldier get killed, then it was Margaret's turn, then the Australian Andrew, and I thought that I will be the next victim."
