London 12-29 (AFP) - British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced this evening, Tuesday, that the four Western hostages who were killed today in Yemen are three Brits and one Australian.


Cook added, in a written statement, that the British Foreign Office advises "all British tourists to leave" Yemen, and those who wish to visit it to refrain from traveling.

He said, "It saddens me very much to confirm that three British tourists were killed (...), and we believe that an Australian was also killed."

Cook explained that two "other" British tourists were wounded in the armed confrontation that inflicted seven wounded, as local police reported. Twelve other tourists were freed.
