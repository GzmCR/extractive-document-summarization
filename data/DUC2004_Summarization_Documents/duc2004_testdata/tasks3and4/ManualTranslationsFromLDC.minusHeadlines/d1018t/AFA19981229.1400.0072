Sana'a 12-29 (AFP) - A new tally obtained from a security source showed that six people, including three Western tourists, were killed and seven others were wounded, including two tourists, in the attack that was carried out today, Tuesday, by Yemeni security forces on the kidnappers of 16 foreign tourists.

The six dead are two British tourists, an American woman, a policeman and two kidnappers who belong to an Islamist group.

Two Western citizens, one of whom is British, three policemen and two kidnappers were wounded in the attack that ended in the arrest of 13 kidnappers.

16 tourists - 12 Brits (six women and six men), two American women and two Australians, were kidnapped yesterday, Monday.  Police had announced that the "Islamic Jihad" group kidnapped the Western tourists and demanded the release of their leader in addition to lifting the embargo imposed upon Iraq.
  
This is the first time a hostage kidnapping operation in Yemen ends up with the infliction of fatalities.

Some 150 foreigners were kidnapped in Yemen in the past few years, and they were released without shedding any blood.

This is also the first time an Islamist group conducts a kidnapping operation in Yemen, where armed tribes usually conduct such operations.
