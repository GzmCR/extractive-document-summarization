First Capsule in International Space Station Takes Position in Orbit

Baikonur (Kazakhstan) 11-20 (AFP) - Officials from the Baikonur Rocket Launching Center in Kazakhstan announced that the first capsule in the International Space Station took its position in its designated orbit in space after the successful launch that carried it into orbit this morning, Friday.

Russian Interfax Agency quoted the same sources that the third stage of the rocket separated as planned, nine minutes and 47 seconds after the rocket launch. The capsule "Zarya" or "The Dawn" was put in its designated orbit at an altitude of 341 kilometers.

The capsule immediately started deploying its solar panels, and settled in its orbit awaiting an American module that will arrive next December carrying a second section of the station consisting of a passageway that allows movement from one capsule to another.

It is due to reach its final orbit within five days at an altitude of 380 Km above the earth.

The second capsule is also due to be sent from Baikonur Center during next summer. The second capsule is considered the core of the space station, and its manufacture, which was assigned to the Russians, was subjected to a delay due to serious financial problems. The American side contributed by paying 60 million dollars to enable their Russian colleagues to complete it according to schedule.

The launch process had taken place at six and 40 minutes international time, in the presence of top officials from the American, Russian and European space agencies, in order to put the components of the space station into orbit. This is the largest unprecedented multi-national civil project, and 16 countries are jointly participating in making it happen.

The station will require 45 launches, similar to the one that took place today, in order to complete all of its elements.  These launches will extend till the year 2004.

The International Station, which is 100 meters in length, is considered a large space lab capable of permanently accommodating six or seven astronauts. The first station crew will explore the station starting in January of the year two thousand.

A spokeswoman for the Space Mission Control Center near Moscow, Vera Medvedkova, said, "Everything went well." She explained that "Zarya", which is operating automatically, "sent its first output during a twenty-minute communication" with the above-mentioned center.
