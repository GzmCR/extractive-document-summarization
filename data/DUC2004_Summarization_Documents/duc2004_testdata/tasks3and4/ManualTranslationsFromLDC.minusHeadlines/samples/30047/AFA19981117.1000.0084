By Christoph Podov &HT; International Space Station Biggest Structure Assembled in Orbit

Moscow 11-17 (AFP) - The International Space Station, the first component of which will be launched next Friday from Baikonur Space Center (Kazakhstan) in 2004, will become the biggest structure to be assembled in orbit, which is a laboratory accessible to researchers and astronauts from the 16 countries that helped establish it.
 
Despite Russia's financial difficulties which threaten to significantly delay the program, the International Space Station's designers decided to keep the November 20th date to launch the module "Zarya" (The Dawn).
 
This decision constitutes a confidence initiative towards the Russians because +Zarya+, which is a multi-purpose payload module, has a limited period of staying in space and will fall to earth in the event Russia was unable, within 500 days, to launch the "Service Module", which is the core of the actual upcoming station that has not been completed yet.

The delay in building this module due to financial reasons has so far resulted in setting the entire program back six months.

The American Space Agency (NASA), the senior engineer of the World Space Station project, allocated 60 million dollars this year to allow the Russians to proceed and promised to give 600 million dollars over the next four years.

According to the current program, the service module is supposed to be launched in July 1999.  The first crew is due to arrive aboard the station in January 2000.

Scientific labs and American, European and Japanese cabins around the Russian section of the station, in addition to other basic components, will be assembled. The giant space station will encompass more than 100 pieces weighing an estimated 460 tons that will be put in orbit thanks to 45 space flights.

Upon completion of the station's assembly process, six or seven astronauts who will be able to conduct medical, physical and other experiments to observe planet earth will inhabit it permanently. The station, with its solar panels, will look like a bat the size of a football field, and it will be visible to the naked eye from earth as a meteor at an altitude of 400 Km.

The formation of the first team, which has been conducting training since the end of 1996, led to sharp disagreements that were settled by appointing an American as a commander of the station while his two assistants, Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, are Russians.  

In the eighties, every country imagined its future in the space arena separately. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan launched the American station "Freedom" project while the Russians were getting ready to launch the Mir Station.

In the face of mounting budget difficulties, the United States sought to find partners. In 1993, the Russians joined the American project which was named the International Space Station, after the Russians failed to finance the "Mir II" project.
 
Besides Russian and the United States, Japan, Canada, Brazil, and the 11 European Space Agency's countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain) are participating in the project.
   
The first phase of the project was dedicated to plan encounters between the Russian Mir station and American stations, and inhabitation of American and European astronauts aboard the Mir Station.
 
The second phase of the project is centered on assembling the World Space Station, which will begin soon. The Russians are offering their unique expertise in the area of managing a space station, while the Europeans are providing advanced technology and financial capitals.

It is expected that the space station will be operated initially for 15 years, but the example of the Russian Mir Station, which was originally launched for five years and is still operating without interruption for 13 years, calls for optimism.
