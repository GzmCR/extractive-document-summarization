First Capsule in International Space Station Takes Position in Orbit

Baikonur (Kazakhstan) 11-20 (AFP) - Officials from the Baikonur Rocket Launching Center in Kazakhstan announced that the first capsule in the International Space Station took its position in its designated orbit in space after the successful launch that carried into orbit this morning, Friday.
   
Russian Interfax Agency quoted the same sources that the third stage of the rocket separated as planned, nine minutes and 47 seconds after the rocket launch. The capsule "Zarya" or "The Dawn" was put in its designated orbit at an altitude of 341 kilometers.

The capsule immediately started deploying its solar panels and settled in its orbit awaiting an American module that will arrive next December carrying a second section of the station consisting of a passageway that allows movement from one capsule to another.

The second capsule is due to be sent from Baikonur Center during next summer.

The launch process took place at six and 40 minutes international time in the presence of top officials from the American, Russian and European space agencies in order to put in orbit the components of the space station, which is being jointly achieved by 16 countries.
  
The station will require 45 launches, similar to the one that took place today, in order to complete all of its components.  These launches will extend till the year 2004.

The International Station, which is 100 meters in length, is considered a large space lab capable of permanently accommodating six or seven astronauts.
