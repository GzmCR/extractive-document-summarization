Houston 2-17 (AFP) - Russian module "Zarya" docked with the American communications module "Unity" yesterday evening, Sunday, in space, an event that constituted the birth of the International Space Station, according to what the American Space Agency reported at Johnson Center in Houston (Texas).

The commander of the American Shuttle "Endeavor", Robert Cabana, proclaimed, "Houston, we docked with Zarya."
 
Astronaut Nancy Currie had grabbed Zarya via the Canadian robotic arm in the Shuttle "Endeavor" and slowly brought it closer to the American communications module "Unity" thus forming the nucleus of the International Space Station.
 
The docking of "Unity" with "Zarya", which has been in orbit since the 20th of last November, was completed at 19:07 Houston time (01:07 GMT today, Monday) at an altitude of 340 kilometers.
 
The docking process took place when the American shuttle and module were over Russia.

The docking of Zarya with Unity opens the door for the continuation of building the International Space Station, which is a huge collection encompassing more than 100 parts with a net weight of 460 tons being built jointly by 15 countries. Construction of this station is due to be completed in 2004. Assembling all of its various parts requires 45 flights by a rocket or a shuttle.
 
Three countries participated in putting together the international station's nucleus: the United States with the Shuttle "endeavor", five astronauts and "Unity"; Russia with "Zarya" and astronaut Sergei Krikalev; and Canada with the robotic arm which was used to move "Unity" and "Zarya".  

Starting today, Monday, Astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman will perform the first out of three space walks, lasting six hours each, to connect electrical cables, gas and liquid tubes between Unity and Zarya.
  
Communications module "Unity" is shaped on the outside as a cylinder, five meters in diameter and six meters in length. It houses six docking joints where other parts of the station will be hooked later, including an American lab and a dome with glass openings.

On the inside, "Unity" encompasses six sides where 216 gas and liquid transport tubes are extended. From another angle, 121 electric cables pass inside and outside "Unity".
 
"Unity" was equipped with two synchronization devices to enable it to dock with the American shuttle and Zarya together, raising the total length of the cluster to 12 meters and weight to 11.5 tons.

Zarya (Dawn in Russian) is a cylinder 12 meters in length, four meters in diameter and weighs 19 tons.

As a first stage, Zarya will ensure, thanks to its solar panels, keeping the International Space Station's nucleus in orbit. Upon final completion of the station, the Russian module will be converted into an equipment storeroom and a storage tank with a capacity of six tons of fuel.
 
A third component, the Russian service station that will allow keeping the group in space and receiving a crew of three beginning in the year 2000, will join the existing two components next summer. The first crew will comprise of an American and two Russians, including the astronaut who is currently in the shuttle, Sergei Krikalev.  
 
The station will eventually encompass scientific labs and American, European and Japanese live-in modules that will be continually inhabited by six to seven astronauts conducting physical and medical experiments and earth and space observation missions.

15 countries, which are the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the ten-member countries in the European Space Agency will be represented in the station that can be visible to the naked eye from earth.
