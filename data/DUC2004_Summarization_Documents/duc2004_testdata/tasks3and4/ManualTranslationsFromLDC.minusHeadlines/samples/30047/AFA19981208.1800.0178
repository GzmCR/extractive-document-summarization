International Space Station: Semi-break for Shuttle Endeavor Astronauts

Houston (United States) 12-8 (AFP) - The six astronauts aboard the American space shuttle "Endeavor", including the Russian Sergei Krikalev, spent today, Tuesday, on a semi-break after two exhausting days of building the nucleus of the International Space Station.

They docked the Russian module "Zarya" with the American communications module "Unity" on Sunday to form a seven-story complex.

Astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman connected the cables between "Zarya" and "Unity" which enabled the supply of electric power to "Unity" thanks to the solar panels on the Russian module.

Mission Commander Bob Castle said in a statement to the press that after the two astronauts completed the "skeleton" of the International Space Station, they started its "nervous system".

Part of today was dedicated to performing a few simple tasks in addition to performing checks and preparations for the second space walk by Ross and Newman tomorrow, Wednesday, to attach the communications tower between the station and Mission Control in Houston.

The crew will then spend the rest of the day enjoying the earth's view or entertaining themselves.
