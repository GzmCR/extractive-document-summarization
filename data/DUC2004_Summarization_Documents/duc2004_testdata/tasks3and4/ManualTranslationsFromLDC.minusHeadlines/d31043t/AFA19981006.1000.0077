Beirut: 10-6 (AFP) - General Emile Lahoud's ascent to the Lebanese presidency within a week became certain after he was chosen by Syria.

Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad put the final touches yesterday, Monday, on the open election scenario during a long summit in Damascus with his Lebanese counterpart, Elias Al-Hrawi, whose term ends next November 23.
 
A figure close to President Al-Hrawi confirmed last evening, Monday, to Agence France Presse "that Presidents Al-Assad and Al-Hrawi chose the name of General Emile Lahoud as the next president of the republic in Lebanon."

With that, Emile Lahoud (62 years of age), the Supreme Commander of the Lebanese Army since 28 November 1989, will become the tenth president of the Republic of Lebanon since its independence in 1943, and the first president to be elected in peacetime since the war erupted in 1975.

Among the indications that the presidential eligibility has been decided, Lebanese newspapers printed today, Tuesday, confirmed that Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri made a phone call to General Lahoud from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to tell him "Congratulations, Mr. President."
  
General Lahoud also paid a visit today, Tuesday, to President Al-Hrawi.

The news of General Lahoud's selection for the presidency of the republic occupied the front pages of the Lebanese newspapers and was reported as follows: Al Nahar "It's Decided...and Election of the General as President in 10 Days"; Al Safir "Last Summit for Al-Hrawi Al-Assad: Emile Lahoud President.. for Change"; Addiyar "Eligibility Decision: General Emile Lahoud is the Next President"; Al-Liwaa "Big Decision's Summit: Emile Lahoud President of the Republic".

The disclosure of the selection by Syria, "the Big Elector" in Lebanon for the president of the republic reflected positively on the Lebanese lira immediately.  The national currency registered an improvement against the dollar this morning after it was negatively affected during the past days by the Syrian-Turkish crisis.

It is to be pointed out that the election of Lahoud requires the Parliament to amend Paragraph Three of Article 49 of the constitution which bars high-ranking government employees from being nominated for the presidency of the republic before two years have passed since resigning their positions.  This amendment will be implemented as a result of a proposal to be presented by the president of the republic when he chairs the Council of Ministers' session.
 
Official sources said that the Council of Ministers' session will be held on the day after tomorrow, Thursday, while the Parliament (128 representatives, half of whom are Moslems and the other half Christians) is due to convene next Monday to ratify the amendment.

One of the ministers confirmed to Agence France Presse that the election process would be concluded quickly indicating that it may take place this October 14.

If we exclude the administration period of General Michel Aon, who took over the government at the end of 1989 until the Lebanese and Syrian armies ousted him in October 1990, General Fouad Chehab is the only military man, before Lahoud, who assumed the presidency from July 1958 till July 1964.
 
Despite the inability of any Lebanese figure to oppose the "choice" of Syria, which enjoys an undisputed influence in Lebanon where 35 thousands of its troops are deployed, some politicians, including Druze Minister Walid Junblatt and one of the Christian opposition leaders, Raymond Eddeh, expressed their opposition to the ascension to the presidency by a military man.
  
Eddeh thought, in a statement to the press, "that the election of a military man constitutes a threat to democracy."

In the meantime, Junblatt affirmed that he is "not in favor of the new Chehabism", in reference to the experience of the "Second Bureau" (Army Intelligence) during the administration of President Fouad Chehab, when the Lebanese Army intelligence service was interfering in various state affairs.

Despite the ambiguity surrounding the outcome of presidential eligibility during recent weeks, all indicators were showing for many months that General Lahoud is the candidate with the biggest prospect.
 
Since last spring, Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass praised General Lahoud during one of his visits to Lebanon in a noticeable way.

During the summer period, most media buzz was supportive of the general.
 
On Army Day on the first of August, Beirut was unusually packed with Lebanese flags and banners supporting the Commander of the Army and pointing out his accomplishments in uniting and building the military establishment.

On 31 August, Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul, who is very close to Syria, asserted that Lahoud will be the next president and that he is "the best possible candidate."
 
He said: "We are in need of a president without personal interests in the administration, a president who makes everyone accountable without sharing the spoils."

It is to be indicated that the president of the republic is elected from followers of the Maronite faction, Lebanon's largest Christian faction, as part of an implied agreement (norm) that is still in effect since independence despite the new constitution.
