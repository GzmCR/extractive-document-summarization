Beirut 10-13 (AFP) - The Lebanese Parliament passed today, Tuesday, an amendment of one of the constitution's articles "as a one-time exception" with a majority of 113 votes, so that it can elect the current Army Commander, General Emile Lahoud, president of the republic.
  
117 representatives out of 128 total attended the session.  Four representatives opposed the amendment, and they are Naseeb Lahoud, Butrus Harb, Camille Ziadeh and Najah Wakim.

11 representatives did not attend the session, including 9 representatives from the National Struggle Coalition, which is headed by the Immigrants Minister, Druze leader Walid Junblatt, who had earlier declared his opposition to the ascension to the presidency by a military man.

The government, at the request of the president of the republic, Elias Al-Hrawi, had earlier sent to the Parliamentary Council last Thursday a constitutional bill for amending Article 49, that calls for first-grade employees to submit their resignations two years before they are nominated for the presidency.
 
The amendment, passed by the council, adds a paragraph to the above-mentioned article stating the following, "For one time and as an exception, the president of the republic may be elected from among judges or first-grade employees, or from equivalent positions in all public administrations and public corporations as well as all persons subject to common law."
 
It is likely that the General Commission of the Parliamentary Council will elect the president of the republic on the day after tomorrow, Thursday, if the government was able to publish the amendment in a supplement of the official publication on Wednesday morning, as announced by the Speaker of the Parliament, Nabih Berri.  Otherwise, it is expected that the election date will be set on the 19th of this month.

Agreement had been reached to select General Lahoud to succeed Al-Hrawi, whose term ends next November 24, at the Lebanese-Syrian summit that was held on the fifth of October in Damascus.
