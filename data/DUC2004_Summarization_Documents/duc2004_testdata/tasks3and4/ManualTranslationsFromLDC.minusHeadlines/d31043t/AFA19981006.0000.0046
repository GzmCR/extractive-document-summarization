Beirut 10-6 (AFP)- Raymond Eddeh, one of the Lebanese Christian opposition leaders, considered today, Tuesday, that the election of the Commander of the Lebanese Army, General Emile Lahoud as President of the Lebanese Republic, who was selected during a Lebanese-Syrian summit to succeed the current president Elias Al-Hrawi, will constitute "a threat to democracy."  

Eddeh thought in Paris, where he lives voluntarily in exile since 1976, that "electing a military man constitutes a threat to democracy in Lebanon."

Local newspapers quoted Eddeh as saying that "handing the presidency over to a military man has its risks since officers from various ranks will assume that they enjoy the same authorities as those of their former colleague, and will interfere in the political life."
 
He indicated that "in the Lebanese army, which is 63 thousand men strong, there are 132 generals as opposed to 190 generals in the French ground forces."

Eddeh, the National Coalition Party leader, added that "General Lahoud, like any other Lebanese officer, cannot fight a war against Israel nor against Syria."

Israel occupies a border strip in southern Lebanon, about 850 square kilometers in area, while Syria deploys about 30 thousand of its soldiers on two-thirds of  Lebanese soil.

Eddeh went on to say "Lahoud is unable even to go to Jizzine, which is occupied by Antoine Lahd's army (the pro-Israel south Lebanon army militia), although Lahd recently announced that he is prepared to withdraw with his soldiers from this city if the Lebanese army is prepared to replace him."
   
Eddeh thought that "General Lahoud should be content with uniting the army", which split into Christian and Moslem brigades during the war (1975-1990).
 
Eddeh renewed his position that calls for another three years extension to President Al-Hrawi, reckoning that Al-Hrawi "possesses great experience in state affairs, provided that he has to resign after the withdrawal of the Israeli and Syrian forces."
 
A source close to the Lebanese President's office said that the summit that was held on Monday between Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and Lebanese President Elias Al-Hrawi resulted in the selection of the commander of the Lebanese Army, General Emile Lahoud, to ascend to the presidency in Lebanon.

A well-informed government source confirmed to Agence France Presse that the elections would take place on the fourteenth of this October.
