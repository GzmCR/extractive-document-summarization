Gutenberg (Sweden) 11-2 (AFP) - A new toll released by local police today, Monday, said that the disco fire in Gutenberg has inflicted 62 fatalities and 160 wounded, after two of the wounded died of the severe burns they received.

The Prosecutor-General, Olaf Norin, announced that one or more of the eight organizers of the dance evening, which ended tragically killing 60 people, will be pursued with a charge of negligence leading to the loss of many lives.
  
The judge explained that the organizers of last Thursday's evening will face a judicial investigation, regardless whether the fire was deliberate or not, due to the presence of 400 teenagers at the disco at the instant the fire broke out at a time it is not permitted for discos to accommodate more than 150 customers.
 
A local newspaper reported that the organizer of the evening is a young man of 19 years of age and that he and his cousin died in the disaster.
