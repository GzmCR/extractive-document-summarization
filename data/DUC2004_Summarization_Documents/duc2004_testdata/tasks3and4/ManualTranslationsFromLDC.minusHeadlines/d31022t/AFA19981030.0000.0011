Stockholm 10-30 (AFP) - The head of the Swedish rescue authorities, Linart Ohlin, told the Swedish "TT" Agency that the fire that broke out in a disco in Gutenberg (south) and which killed 60 people and wounded about one hundred others the night of Thursday-Friday, may have been deliberate.
  
He said, "We have indications that make us believe that the fire may have been deliberate."

Nevertheless, Gutenberg police refused, in a response to a question from Agence France Press, to immediately confirm this matter.

Bingt Staff said, "Until now, we do not have accurate information to confirm that the fire is deliberate." He added, "We are still listening to accounts from the young people who were at the scene."
