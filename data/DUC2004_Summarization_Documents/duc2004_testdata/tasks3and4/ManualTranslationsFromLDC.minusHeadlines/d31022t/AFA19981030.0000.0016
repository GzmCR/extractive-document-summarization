Stockholm 10-30 (AFP) - The latest tally issued by the authorities today, Friday, showed that the fire that swept a disco in Hisingsangen near Gutenberg last night, resulted in killing at least 60 people and injuring 190 others, mostly teenagers.
  
Local police explained that the fire, which may have been deliberate, started at 00:30 (at 23:30 Greenwich Meantime yesterday, Thursday) in a backside hall of one of the theatres where 400 young men and women, including people younger than 14 years of age, were celebrating "Halloween."
 
The rescue authority's spokesman, Linart Olin, said that "some indications lead to the belief that the fire may have been deliberate."

He explained that the fire was still raging at the place, which was subjected to inspection in April 1997, when firefighting crews arrived a few minutes after the alarm was sounded and asserted that it is "impossible for the flames to have spread that quickly."

He added that "most victims died from suffocation", explaining that seven of the injured, "are in a hopeless situation" and they were transported in military helicopters to Malmo (south).

Peter Severstedt, in charge of the rescue crews, said that "the fire broke out after an explosion and that the flames swept the entire place."

Gutenberg police, in responding to Agence France Presse's questions, refused to immediately confirm these statements. They explained, "At the present time, we do not have any information that is specific enough to confirm that the fire was deliberate. We are listening to statements from the young people who were present in the disco."

A witness named Jamal Fawwaz (15 years of age) explained to "TV 4" television station that the fire broke out in flood lights that were hanging from the ceiling, adding that the flames spread in the place after these lights fell on the dance floor.  He said, "Everyone rushed toward the exit and a stampede occurred on the way out."
 
Another witness of sixteen years of age said that he was outside the disco when "he saw persons hurrying outside screaming that there is some fire while thick smoke started to come out of ventilation ducts."
 
Other witnesses confirmed that rescue workers worked amidst a state of confusion in the initial stage. Dalako Salwati (19 years of age) said, "Panic took hold.  Screaming was coming out of the disco where the fire broke out and people were running in all directions. Rescue workers worked to push people away from the scene in order to place the ladders."

A seventeen year old young man told the public station "TV 2" that one of his friends saved him from the flames, sacrificing his life; "I was lying on the floor, unable to breathe and could not see anything because of the smoke so he pulled me out toward the exit and saved my life."

Police explained that a number of taxicabs, private cars, buses and ambulances were dispatched to the scene to transport the injured to Gutenberg's four hospitals, which brought respirators from throughout the area.

Hospitals in neighboring Denmark were put on alert since the hospitals in Sweden were full.
