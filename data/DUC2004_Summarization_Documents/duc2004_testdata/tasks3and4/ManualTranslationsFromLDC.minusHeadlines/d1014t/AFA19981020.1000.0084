Algiers 10-20 (AFP) - Mohammad Bushtein, the Algerian regime's strongman, withdrew from the political arena as a result of a campaign by the press against him, in which it denounced the "excesses" he committed, at a time when no candidate has come forward for the presidential elections which are due to be held in early 1999 for President Liamine Zeroual's succession.

Bushtein resigned his post as an advisor to the Algerian administration opting not to embarrass the government coalition in its effort to appoint a candidate to replace President Zeroual. The latter had decided to give up his post early in the coming year before the end of his term.
 
The press campaign launched by the opposition in the beginning of last summer season was aimed at affirming that Bushtein took advantage of his position as a counseling minister to the president to realize private gains on the one hand, and to eliminate his enemies on the other.
 
President Zeroual had surprised everyone last September 11 when he announced the abbreviation of his presidential term, which was supposedly due to end in the year two thousand, and the planning of early presidential elections in which he will not be a candidate. 

He affirmed that this aims to consolidate the principle of succession of governing, but the Algerian press said that this decision resulted from disagreements between the Algerian regime's ranks.

Retired Lieutenant General Mohammad Bushtein, who was one of the founders of the Democratic National Assembly - the most important party in the government coalition - was able to consolidate his status over the months to the point where he became the regime's strongman, and he forced his point of view in state affairs. 

Bushtein is considered the decision maker of the negotiation with the (dissolved) Islamic Front for Rescue, which led to the partial release of its chairman, Abbasi Madani, in July 1997 (before he was placed again under house arrest), and the release of the third man in the Front, Abdel Kader Hashani.
  
However, he apparently did not embark on any role in cultivating the truce announced unilaterally by the Islamic Army for Rescue (the armed wing of the Islamic Front) since October 1997.

This truce has not resulted in stopping the violence that is bloodying the country since 1992 and which led to the killing of more than 70 thousand people, according to Western sources. The wave of violence had shifted in recent months to the western part of the country.

The withdrawal of Bushtein, who is described by the secular and democratic movement as "Islamist-conservative", raises questions on how to deal with the Islamic movement in the future.

The Democratic National Assembly, which failed to convince the president to back down from his decision to abbreviate his term, became subject to internal struggles between two movements, according to newspapers' reports.
 
On the other hand, Bushtein's resignation coincided with the resignation of the Justice Minister, Mohammad Adami, who is considered very close to him and who also was subjected to press campaigns that denounced his "excesses", "his abuse of power", "his law violation" and "his repeated interferences" in judges' work.

The newspapers, which made the two officials a target for their campaign, decided to refrain from publication starting last Sunday and for "an indefinite" period in protest of the government's effort, as quoted by them, to take away "freedom of the press and the democratic expression."
 
This came in response to the latest warning issued by government printing presses to newspapers to payoff their debts within 48 hours or stop publication. The newspapers considered that the printing presses acted on the enticement of the government which wants to punish them for the scandals they revealed.
