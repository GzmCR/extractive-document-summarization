Bonn 11-4 (AFP) - Al-Rabat Bulletin, which is close to the Algerian Islamic Rescue Front, denounced in the latest issue, which Agence France Presse in Bonn received a copy of, the decision to postpone the presidential elections in Algeria to April.
  
The Algerian President Liamine Zeroual had announced last September 11 the abbreviation of his term and the planning of early presidential elections next February, which was then announced on Saturday will be postponed to April.

Al-Rabat said that "two additional months to plan presidential elections will be a waste before starting to clear the political situation and embarking on rectifying the devastated economic situation of the country as a result of years of corruption and futile management."
 
It added that "President Liamine Zeroual asserts through postponing the election date that he is but a tool or a pawn that is being directed in accordance with the needs of the present time." It went on to say, "Nothing justifies this delay, which proves that the word of the head of the state is not trustworthy or credible."

It affirmed that "the entire potential candidates for this election are hoping to ascend to the presidency of the republic with the consent and support of the military establishment. The parties are always awaiting the army's decision before they assume their positions; and consequently, no candidate has announced his intention to compete for the presidential post."
