Algeria 10-31 (AFP) - Algerian President Liamine Zeroual confirmed in an address he gave to the nation this evening, Saturday, that the early presidential elections will be held next April.

The Algerian president, who was elected in November 1995, had surprised everyone by his announcement on September 11 that he will abbreviate his term. He said that he will not be nominated again for the presidential elections, which he had announced will be held by the end of next February.

Zeroual announced in a letter he addressed to the Algerian political parties today, Saturday, that these elections "will be held in April," in order to give the parties additional time to prepare for them.

The parties, which Zeroual consulted during the past few weeks, had expressed their desire to postpone the elections, arguing that the interval given by the president until the end of February was very short.

In an address via state television on the occasion of the outbreak of the Liberation War on the first of November 1954, Zeroual said, "I have decided to postpone the date of the elections to next April in order to allow every party the chance to prepare for this important national date."

He reaffirmed anew the state's determination to "eradicate terrorism from Algerian soil."
