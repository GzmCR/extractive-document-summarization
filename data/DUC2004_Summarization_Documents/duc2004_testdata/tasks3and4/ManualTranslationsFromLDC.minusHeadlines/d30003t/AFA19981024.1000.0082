Madrid 10-24 (AFP) - The Spanish "El Mundo" newspaper, published today, Saturday, reported that a Spanish lawyer filed a complaint against the Moroccan monarch, King Hassan II, accusing him of genocide against the Saharan people, and submitted it to the National Court and Judge Baltasar Garzon, who was behind the Pinochet case.
   
Francisco Fernandez Goberna, who is 45 years old, filed the above-mentioned complaint last September 15 before the Criminal Chamber, overseen by Judge Garzon, and he is patiently awaiting the Chamber's decision in the National Court that will decide next Thursday whether the Spanish justice system has jurisdiction to pursue the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, who was detained on the 16th of this month in London.
    
The newspaper explained that the lawyer is hoping, in light of the Criminal Chamber's decision on the Spanish justice system's jurisdiction, that the complaint he filed will lead to the issuance of an international arrest warrant.

The lawyer, who prepared his dossier with the help of a representative of the Sahara Republic, asserted "my goal is to make King Hassan II accountable for his crimes."

The complaint is targeting the Moroccan monarch in his capacity as the "highest political and military authority" and is accused by the lawyer of committing "criminal acts against the people of the Sahara indiscriminately" in the Western Sahara from 1975 to 1990.

The Spanish lawyer is citing the migration of half of the Saharan people to Algeria in 1975 in the aftermath of Morocco's onslaught against the Western Sahara and the use of weapons of mass destruction such as Napalm.
 
The newspaper added that on the eighth of this month, the lawyer added to the complaint he filed a charge of genocide - which is a crime that is not subject to the statue of limitations - and supported it with a list of 168 persons who disappeared during that period.
