London 10-8-1 (AFP) - The Home Secretary at the British Interior Ministry, Allen Michael, announced that Chilean General Augusto Pinochet, who was detained the day before yesterday, Friday, in Britain, carries a diplomatic passport that "does not ensure him diplomatic immunity."
 
He explained in a conversation with "BBC" that the diplomatic passport "does not necessarily guarantee diplomatic immunity."

The Chilean government rejects this explanation, affirming that the former dictator enjoys diplomatic immunity in his capacity as "a member in the Senate for life" since last March when he left the command of the Chilean armed forces.

Michael said that Pinochet came to Britain "with a passport that does not require a visa, and it is likely that he may have presented, supported with evidence, medical reasons for requiring treatment and therefore, there was no reason for immigration authorities to prevent him" from entering the country upon his arrival.

He added, "After his arrival and checking in a hospital, the Spanish authorities filed a request (to hand him over), which police and justices must decide upon in forty days, during which period the Spanish authorities must justify their request.

He added, intentionally responding to accusations levied against the Labor government that it acted with political motivations, "It is a very clear procedure and there was no inappropriate intervention."

The Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Office had earlier purposely asserted that the case is strictly in the jurisdiction of the police and the justice system.
