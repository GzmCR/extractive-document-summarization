Madrid 10-23 (AFP) - Judicial sources announced that the Spanish Prosecutor-General (the highest Spanish judicial authority) notified Judge Baltasar Garzon today, Friday, that he opposes him in his demand for Britain to extradite the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet. 
  
The judge had earlier requested from the Prosecutor-General and from the civil prosecuting authorities to provide him with the results of their effort regarding a possible extradition of Pinochet by Saturday. The same judicial authority's judge will announce in early November whether or not he will decide to seek the dictator's extradition. 

The Prosecutor-General stressed, in the results he announced today, that the Spanish justice system does not have jurisdiction outside its national territories to pursue the Chilean dictator and the fact that Pinochet still enjoys diplomatic immunity as a senator for life, according to what this judicial authority said.
 
The prosecutor had filed a complaint last week against the arrest warrant issued by Judge Garzon against Pinochet.
