Madrid 10-22 (AFP) - Spanish judicial sources confirmed today, Thursday, that Judge Baltasar Garzon intends to submit a request to extradite General Augusto Pinochet from Britain starting on the first of next month in case the Prosecutor-General, the highest Spanish penal authority, approves that request next week.
    
The Spanish Prosecutor-General appealed last Monday the arrest warrant issued by Judge Garzon, which allowed the arrest of the former dictator in London where he underwent a surgical procedure.
 
The Penal Chamber of the Prosecutor-General will discuss the appeal request next week while Judge Garzon continues to prepare the extradition dossier.  The extradition request will be subject to the cabinet's approval as the final authority in case it is endorsed.
