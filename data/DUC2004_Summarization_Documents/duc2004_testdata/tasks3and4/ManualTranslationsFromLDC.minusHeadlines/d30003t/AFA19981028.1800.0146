Madrid 10-28 (AFP) - The Spanish government expressed today, Wednesday, its "deep respect" for the Supreme Court's decision in London to nullify the arrest warrant issued against the former Chilean president, General Augusto Pinochet, due to the diplomatic immunity that he enjoys.
 
In response to reporters' questions in the Spanish Parliament's corridors, Ramon Du Miguel, Minister of State for Foreign Relations in charge of European Union affairs, affirmed the Spanish authorities' "deep institutional respect" for the decision taken by the British Supreme Court.
  
In London today, Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that the arrest warrant under which the former Chilean president General Augusto Pinochet was arrested, "null", but it ordered that he remain under arrest regardless.
 
Judges, who received a request from Pinochet's lawyers to free him, decided to keep the former Chilean president (80 years of age) under arrest in his room at the hospital where he is being treated in case an appeal is filed against the court's decision.

The Prosecutor-General's Office immediately announced its intention to appeal the decision. Supposedly, the case will now go to the House of Lords, the country's highest judicial authority, which must decide on it.  A spokesman for the Prosecutor-General's Office said that the appeal process "may take several weeks."
