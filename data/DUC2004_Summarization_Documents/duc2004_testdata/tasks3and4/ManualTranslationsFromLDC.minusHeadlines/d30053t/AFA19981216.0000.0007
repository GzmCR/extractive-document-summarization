Washington 12-16 (AFP) - American President Bill Clinton returned yesterday evening, Tuesday, to Washington arriving from Israel at the end of a difficult tour he conducted in the Middle East.
 
An official source said that the presidential plane landed at Andrews Air Base at 23:05 local time (4:05 GMT).
 
During his trip to the Middle East that took three days, Clinton made the first visit by an American president to the Palestinian Territories and participated in a three-way meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.

Yet, he did not succeed in changing the position of Netanyahu, who again opted to appease the Israeli radical right, which threatens to bring down his government and rejects any concessions under the framework of the peace process.
 
The American president faces on Thursday a vote in the House of Representatives, and he may become the second president in the history of the United States voted to be removed by the House of Representatives.
