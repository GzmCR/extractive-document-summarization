Jerusalem 12-10 (AFP) - Israeli Police Commissioner Yehuda Wilk announced today, Thursday, that he expects Palestinian rioting to take place in East Jerusalem during President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian Territories that will last three days.
  
He told reporters, "We believe that there will be an attempt to move the riots from the West Bank to East Jerusalem."

Clinton arrives in Israel the night of Saturday-Sunday at a time when arguments are intensifying between the Israelis and Palestinians over ways to implement the Wye Plantation Accord, which was personally sponsored by Clinton in hope of resuming the peace process.

Clashes that have been continuing for several days in the Palestinian Territories resulted in two dead and hundreds of wounded among the Palestinians, in addition to ten wounded Israelis.
  
Commissioner Wilk did not rule out the possibility of an operation against the Israelis during Clinton's visit despite his assurance of "the non-existence of any threat against Clinton's life."

He added that "police have specific information about the desire of radical Palestinians to instigate riots."

He explained that the police, as a precaution for any possibility, will start deploying their forces tomorrow morning, Friday, in Israel; a matter considered to be one of the most complicated operations in police history whereas 14620 policemen will be deployed, including 500 in the perimeter of the Hilton Hotel in Jerusalem where Clinton will be staying.
 
The city center of Jerusalem will be closed to traffic during the American president's visit.
