New York 12-8 (AFP) - Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said during his meeting with American Jewish community representatives today, Tuesday, in New York that the visit of American President Bill Clinton to Gaza will be decisive as far as the Palestinian Territories final status negotiations are concerned.
 
Olmert affirmed before the major American Jewish Organizations Leaders Conference that this visit, which will begin the night of Saturday-Sunday in Jerusalem, may "give a push to future negotiations or may destroy them."

He added, "This visit will crown the Wye Plantation Accord and launch a new phase of negotiations on the final status," in a reference to the agreement signed on 23 October between Israel and the Palestinians.

Clinton is expected to arrive in Gaza on Monday in the first visit of its kind by an American president to the Palestinian Territories. Clinton will attend a meeting of the Palestinian National Council during which it is expected to affirm the nullification of the articles that call for the annihilation of Israel in the Palestinian National Charter.  

Olmert said, "If President Clinton's visit to Gaza does not bring about an unquestioned commitment (from the Palestinians), the chances for achieving progress will be lost forever."
