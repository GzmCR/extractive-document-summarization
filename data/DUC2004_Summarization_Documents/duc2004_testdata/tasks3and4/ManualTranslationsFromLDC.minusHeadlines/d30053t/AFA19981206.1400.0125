Jerusalem 12-6 (AFP) - Israeli ministers expressed their concern today, Sunday, about the possibility that American President Bill Clinton's visit to the Palestinian Territories in the middle of this month will harm the interests of the Hebrew state.

Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, disavow this visit by saying that it was decided upon "by an initiative from the president (Bill Clinton) and not from Israel."

Clinton is due to arrive next Saturday evening for a four-day visit to Jerusalem and Gaza.

National Education Minister, Yitzchak Levi, criticized Clinton's visit to Gaza, in a statement to Israeli radio, arguing that the American president is covering up with that "a Palestinian maneuver."

Levi, one of the radical right leaders, added that the Palestinians do not intend on calling for a meeting of the Palestinian National Congress (the highest authority in the Palestine Liberation Organization).

The Wye Plantation Accord that was signed by the Palestinian and Israeli sides calls for a meeting of the Palestinian National Congress next week in Gaza in the presence of Clinton to affirm the nullification of the anti-Israel articles in the Palestinian Charter.  

Levi said that "the President of the United States comes to participate in a ceremony that contradicts with an agreement he engineered himself."
 
Israeli Science Minister, Silvan Shalom, accused the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, during the annual meeting of the cabinet that he suggested for Clinton to visit the Gaza Strip, according to what the Israeli radio said.

A sharp verbal argument ensued where the two officials exchanged accusations of responsibility for leaking information harmful to the government interests.

The Palestinians responded stressing that President Clinton is coming to give "support for peace."
  
International Cooperation Minister, Nabil Shaath, said, "I do not know why the Israeli officials are afraid of President Clinton's visit. It is a visit that was decided upon at Wye Plantation."

He added, "I think that (this visit) is important for supporting peace and also for supporting the Palestinian people and its aspirations."

The argument about Clinton's visit comes two days before the arrival of the American envoy, Dennis Ross, to the Middle East to prepare for the American president's visit. His deputy, Aaron Miller, preceded him to the region today, Sunday. 

American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to meet in turn tomorrow, Monday, with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, who is visiting the United States.
