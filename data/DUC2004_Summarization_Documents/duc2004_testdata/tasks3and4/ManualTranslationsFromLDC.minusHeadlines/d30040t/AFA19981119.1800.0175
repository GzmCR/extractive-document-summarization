Rabat 11-19 (AFP) - Identical sources said in Rabat today, Thursday, that the Royal Moroccan Airlines (official) may commence the first flight next Sunday to the Palestinian Gaza Airport, which begins its operations that day.

Royal Moroccan Airlines will thus become the first Arab company whose planes land in Gaza Airport, which was commissioned for operation by Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after a two-year delay.

An official of the Moroccan National Airport Office, who asked to remain anonymous, said that this "special" flight for Royal Moroccan Airlines may carry a Moroccan delegation to Gaza.

Gaza Airport is located near the Egyptian borders, south of the Gaza Strip that is administered by the Palestinian Authority.

The official at the Moroccan National Airport Office added that this trip is not inaugural, but it is to transport Moroccan officials to Gaza, including officials from the National Office, which contributed to constructing this first Palestinian airport.

He added that the National Office was still awaiting till this evening, Thursday, the Palestinian Authorities' approval of this flight.
 
Royal Moroccan Airlines had announced on Wednesday its decision to schedule two weekly flights - Tuesdays and Fridays - between Casablanca and Gaza, immediately upon the opening of the airport.
 
Morocco contributed to the construction of the Gaza Airport and, since April 1997, is qualifying the airport's personnel whereas 70 Palestinians are attending training courses in Morocco.
