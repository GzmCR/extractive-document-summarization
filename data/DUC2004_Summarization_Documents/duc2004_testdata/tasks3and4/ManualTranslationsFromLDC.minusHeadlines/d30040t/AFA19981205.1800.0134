Amman 12-5 (AFP) - The first plane belonging to the Palestinian Airlines to make a commercial flight returned today, Saturday, to Gaza Airport from Marka Airport in Amman with 42 passengers aboard after it took off this morning from Gaza International Airport.

Agence France Presse's correspondent, who accompanied the plane, said that the return flight took one hour and forty minutes.

It left from Gaza and arrived in Amman Airport with 45 passengers aboard at 13:00 and departed it after an hour.

The plane returned to Gaza International Airport where it landed at 3:45 local time (01:45 GMT) with 42 passengers, who are holders of Palestinian and Jordanian passports, aboard.
 
As soon as the plane returned, the Israeli side tried again to obstruct the return of passengers aboard the Palestinian plane and delayed them for one and a half hours because of a new condition, imposed by the Israeli side, which is to collect customs duties inside the Rafah crossing point and not inside the airport, which is against what was agreed upon in the Airport Operation Protocol.

It is worth mentioning that Rafah crossing point will be temporarily used to process passengers until the joint Palestinian Israeli suite is completed.

The plane carried from Marka Airport 42 passengers, mostly Palestinians who were visiting Jordan.

The plane's departure was delayed nearly four hours because of disagreements between the Israelis and Palestinians over security checking procedures.

A Palestinian security official told Agence France Presse that "Israel tried to impose security restrictions that contradicted with the Wye Plantation Accord'" which was signed by the Israelis and Palestinians last October 23.

The official, who asked to remain anonymous, explained, "The Israelis wanted to conduct the checking themselves in Gaza Airport, which was absolutely rejected by the Palestinians, even if it led to the cancellation of the flight."

He added that "passengers were subjected to a Palestinian check at Gaza Airport, then they were transported in a bus to Rafah crossing point, located two kilometers from the departure lounge, accompanied by Palestinian security elements, and led by a vehicle belonging to the Israeli security apparatus.

Nevertheless, this delay did not affect the morale and joy of passengers for taking off for the first time in history from a Palestinian airport.

Fayez Al Kadwa, an employee at the Palestinian Authority's Finance Ministry, said, "It is a historic day because it is one of the symbols of our Palestinian state."

The Chairman of the Aviation Authority, Fayez Zeidan, declared, "This is the first time a Palestinian plane takes off from Gaza Airport. It is a historic event. We are optimistic that this airport will bring about "a coup in the Palestinian economic situation."
 
Rhonda Yaghi, a student in Jordan, asserted, "I used to need twenty hours to travel, and despite the Israeli problems, this is much better than the humiliation on the crossing points or at Ben Gurion Airport."

The plane took off amid the applause of passengers who were welcomed in Amman after an hour and a half with flower bouquets.

Palestinian Authority President, Yasser Arafat, officially inaugurated the Gaza International Airport on the twenty-fourth of last month.

Fayez Zeidan announced that starting with this first flight, regular flights will connect Gaza with the Jordanian capital and the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, several times a week, and to Cairo starting from the 11th of this month.

Gaza International Airport is capable of receiving seven hundred thousand passengers annually over the short term.
