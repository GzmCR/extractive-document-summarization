Amman 12-5 (AFP) - The first plane belonging to the Palestinian Airlines to make a commercial flight arrived today, Saturday, in Marka Airport in Amman, and it is due to stay one hour after which it return to Gaza.

Agence France Presse's correspondent said that the plane, a "Fokker 5-0", was carrying aboard 45 passengers holding Palestinian and Jordanian passports in addition to a Canadian citizen.

The plane will carry from Marka Airport 45 passengers, mostly Palestinians who were visiting Jordan.

The plane's departure was delayed nearly four hours because of disagreements between the Israelis and Palestinians over security checking procedures.

A Palestinian security official told Agence France Presse that "Israel tried to impose security restrictions that contradicted with the Wye Plantation Accord," which was signed by the Israelis and Palestinians last November 23.
 
The official, who asked to remain anonymous, explained, "The Israelis wanted to conduct the checking themselves in Gaza Airport, which was absolutely rejected by the Palestinians, even if it led to the cancellation of the flight."
 
He added that "passengers were subjected to a Palestinian check at Gaza Airport, then they were transported in a bus to Rafah crossing point, located two kilometers from the departure lounge, accompanied by Palestinian security elements and led by a vehicle belonging to the Israeli security apparatus.
