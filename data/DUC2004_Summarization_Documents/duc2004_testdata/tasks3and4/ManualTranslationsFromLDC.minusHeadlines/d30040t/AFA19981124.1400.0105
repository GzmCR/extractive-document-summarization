Rafah (Gaza Strip) 11-24 (AFP) - The Palestinians opened today, Tuesday, amid an atmosphere of joy the Gaza International Airport, the new gateway to the world that will give a glimmer of hope to the emergent Palestine.
  
President Yasser Arafat said, upon receiving the four Egyptian government delegates who arrived aboard the first Egypt Air "Airbus 32-0" plane to land at the airport, "It is a historic day for the Palestinians."

Following the Egyptian plane, eight other planes arrived from Morocco, Jordan, Spain, Austria and even from Israel, which carried the Special European Envoy to the Middle East, Miguel Angel Moratinos.
  
A "Fokker 5-0" plane, belonging to the Palestinian Airlines before Arafat's "Jet Star 2" private plane, that will carry him tomorrow, Wednesday, to Paris. Arafat has reserved his first official trip abroad to depart from Gaza Airport for France.

Palestinian officials regard the airport as a new symbol of sovereignty but also as an economic outlet for the Palestinians who were facing considerable difficulties with leaving their territories and with exporting.
   
Chief Negotiator Saeb Arekat said that "opening the airport demonstrates that we returned to the political, geographical and economic map."

As far as he is concerned, the head of the Palestinian Preventative Security Apparatus in the Gaza Strip, Mohamad Al Dahlan, said that "it is very important for the Palestinians because it is one of the symbols of sovereignty." 

Nevertheless, the limited self-rule that the Palestinians enjoy became evident when Israeli security agents in civilian clothes entered the planes that landed in the airport to search them after the official delegates had left.

Despite these controls, thousands of Palestinians, including a large number of Palestinian Authority officials and police, descended on the airport to express their joy with singing and dancing.

Two Palestinian musical bands, belonging to the Palestinian Forces, played the two national anthems as guests entered the VIP lounge at the airport, modeled after the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

Egyptian Information Minister, Safwat El Sherif, declared, "I am very delighted to be here in Palestine."

Hundreds of joyful people coming from the neighboring Palestinian city of Rafah entered into the airport runways between every landing of planes, oblivious onto the simplest rules of safety.
 
The Palestinian Authority and Israel had signed last week, in accordance with the Wye Plantation Accord, a protocol agreement on operating the airport.

Nevertheless, flights scheduled today, Tuesday, are listed as part of the airport's inauguration and the regularly-scheduled commercial flights are due to start operating at a later undetermined time.

Palestinian businessmen are relying on the opening of the airport to export their products directly, since the closure measures Israel imposes for security reasons routinely hinder the transportation of such products by land.

In a first stage, flights will be operated from Gaza to Cairo, Amman and Jeddah, and later on to Turkey and Cyprus. It is to be mentioned that the airport is capable of receiving 700 thousand passengers annually and receiving giant planes like the Boeing 747 model.

The Palestinians completed the construction of the airport two years ago, but Israel, until the signing of the Wye Plantation Accord last October, was still refusing to give permission to operate under the pretext of security reasons.

Israel will have the right to join in the process of checking passengers and cargo at the airport, as she does along all external borders of the Palestinian self-rule areas.
