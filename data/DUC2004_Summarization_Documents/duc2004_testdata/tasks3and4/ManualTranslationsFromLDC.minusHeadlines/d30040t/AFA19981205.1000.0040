Rafah (Gaza Strip) 12-5 (AFP) - The first Palestinian commercial flight took off today, Saturday, more than four hours late from its official schedule, because of disagreements between the Israelis and Palestinians over security checking procedures.

Agence France Presse's correspondent said that a "Fokker 5-0" plane belonging to the Palestinian Airlines, left Gaza International Airport heading to the Jordanian capital, Amman, carrying aboard 45 passengers holding Palestinian and Jordanian passports in addition to a Canadian citizen.

The flight departure was delayed for four hours because of a disagreement between the Israelis and Palestinians on checking procedures.

Passengers were transported three kilometers to Rafah land crossing point in special buses where the Israelis checked their passports before they returned to the airport to board the plane.

Passengers were escorted in buses by members from the Palestinian and Israeli security apparatus.

This procedure is supposed to be implemented for a period of three months until a checking center building at the airport is completed.

The presence of four members from the Israeli security apparatus was noticed in the luggage check-in hall, before the departure of this flight.
  
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat had officially opened Gaza International Airport last November 24.

The Chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez Zeidan, told reporters that regular flights will be scheduled weekly to Amman and Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
