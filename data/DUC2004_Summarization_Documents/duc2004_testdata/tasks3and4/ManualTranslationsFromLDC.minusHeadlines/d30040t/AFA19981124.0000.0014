Rafah (Gaza Strip) 11-24 (AFP) - An Egyptian civilian plane landed today, Tuesday, at the Gaza International Airport, the new symbol of Palestinian sovereignty and the economic outlet for Palestinians.

At 8:30 local time (6:30 GMT), an Airbus plane belonging to Egypt Air Company arriving from Cairo landed on the airport runway followed by a Moroccan Airlines plane arriving from Casablanca.

Three thousand people, including hundreds of reporters, applauded when the famed Egyptian actor, Adel Imam, descended from the Egyptian plane.

Two musical bands, belonging to the Palestinian Forces, played the two national anthems while the guests entered the VIP lounge at the airport.

President Yasser Arafat said upon receiving the four Egyptian government delegates who arrived aboard the first plane to land at the airport, "It is a historic day for the Palestinians."

He added, "We thank our Egyptian brothers for what they did for the Palestinians."
 
The Egyptian Information Minister, Safwat El Sherif, announced, "I am very delighted to be here in Palestine."
 
Officials from the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Legislative Council were also at the airport. The American Consul-General in Jerusalem, John Hearst, and an high-level Israeli officer in military uniform were among the dignitaries.

According to the flight schedule, it is expected that seven other planes will land at Gaza Airport today, in particular a plane belonging to the Palestinian Airlines and from Jordan, Spain, Austria and Sweden.

The airport, which is located in Rafah in the southern part of Gaza Strip near the borders with Egypt, was decorated today with the flags of these countries.

Arafat's private plane, which was until now using the Egyptian airport of Al Arish in Sinai, was expected to land in Gaza Airport to be prepared for carrying the president tomorrow, Wednesday, to Paris. Arafat confirmed that he will devote his first international trip from Gaza Airport to France.

Israelis in civilian clothes were seen, away from the glitter, conducting passenger and cargo searches.

Israel and the Palestinian Authority had signed last week, in accordance with the Wye Plantation Accord, a protocol agreement for operating the airport.

Nevertheless, flights scheduled today are listed as part of the airport's inauguration and the regularly scheduled commercial flights are due to start operating at a later undetermined time.

Palestinian businessmen are relying on the opening of the airport to export their products directly, since the closure measures Israel imposes for security reasons routinely hinder the transportation of such products by land.

In a first phase, flights will be operated from Gaza to Cairo, Amman and Jeddah, and later on to Turkey and Cyprus. It is to be mentioned that the airport is capable of receiving 700 thousand passengers annually and receiving giant planes like the Boeing 747 model.
  
The Palestinians completed the construction of the airport two years ago, but Israel, until the signing of the Wye Plantation Accord last October, was still refusing to give permission to operate under the pretext of security reasons.

Israel will have the right to join in the process of checking passengers and cargo at the airport, as she does along all external borders of the Palestinian self-rule areas.
