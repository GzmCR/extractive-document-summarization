Abu Dhabi 12-9 (AFP) - The six Gulf Cooperation Council countries called on Baghdad today, Wednesday, to unconditionally adhere to United Nations resolutions, and held Iraq responsible for the suffering of its people.
  
A statement distributed at the conclusion of the annual Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in Abu Dhabi stressed on "the need for the Iraqi government to closely and honestly adhere to and implement all Security Council resolutions, unconditionally and without exemption, particularly the ones dealing with the removal of all weapons of mass destruction and the releasing of prisoners and detainees."
   
It considered this "to contribute to the easing of the imposed sanctions against Iraq, and the relieving the suffering from the Iraqi people, for which the Iraqi government bears full responsibility."
