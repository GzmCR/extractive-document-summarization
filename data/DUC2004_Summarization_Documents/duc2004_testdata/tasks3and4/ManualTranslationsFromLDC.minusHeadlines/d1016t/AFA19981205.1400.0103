Abu Dhabi 12-5 (AFP) - Diplomats in the Gulf announced to Agence France Press today, Saturday, that the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, who will hold their nineteenth annual summit the day after tomorrow, Monday, in Abu Dhabi, will express to United Nations' Secretary-General Kofi Anan their concern regarding the United States attempts to change the regime in Iraq.
 
A Western diplomat, who asked that his name remain anonymous, said, "The leaders of the Gulf states will convey to Kofi Anan their concern regarding the American attempts aiming at toppling the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein."

The same diplomat added, "The Gulf states do not want to create a precedent in the region, even if these attempts were directed against a regime they do not want to deal with."

The American Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, had admitted last Thursday that the United States changed her policy on Iraq and that she is seeking from now on to topple the regime established in Baghdad for twenty years.

Another diplomat thought that the Gulf states leaders "feel that they are between a rock and a hard place, and although some of them implicitly wish for a change to the Iraqi regime, they practically oppose any outside intervention in their countries' internal affairs."
 
An Arab diplomat said in Abu Dhabi today, Saturday, that Anan, on the occasion of his participation in the opening of the Gulf summit, will meet Monday with the President of the State of the Emirates, Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahayan; the Saudi Crown Prince, Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz; and the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
 
Besides that, Anan will meet with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab Nations, Esmat Abdel Majid; the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference Organization, Ezzidin Al-Iraqi; and the President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.

Anan will deliver a speech at the summit's opening session, then will hold a press conference the evening of the same day, and leave the Emirates on Tuesday.
