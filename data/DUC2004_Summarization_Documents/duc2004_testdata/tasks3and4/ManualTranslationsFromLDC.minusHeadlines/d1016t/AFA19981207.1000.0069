Abu Dhabi 12-7 (AFP) - The Secretary-General of the League of Arab Nations, Esmat Abdel Majid, called the Gulf states today, Monday, to unite their efforts in order to play a role in the process of oil pricing.
 
Abdel Majid told reporters in Abu Dhabi, where he is visiting to attend the opening of the Nineteenth Gulf Cooperation Council Summit, "The Abu Dhabi summit is a good opportunity to unite the efforts of the countries of the Gulf States Cooperation Council in the area of oil pricing.

Abdel Majid expressed in a statement to the Emirates News Agency "the hope that the oil price deterioration crisis would pass peacefully if the opinions of the Council's countries about it were united."

He thought that "the Council's countries can agree on one policy and one opinion in the economic field whereas the Gulf Region represents an economic heavyweight that must be taken into account a thousand times."

The subject of improving oil prices will be among the priorities in the discussions to be held by leaders of the Gulf states, whose economies suffered greatly as a result of the fall in oil prices in world markets.
 
The Emirates Information Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, announced yesterday, Sunday, "that this subject will take on a great deal of importance" at the summit of the Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
  
These countries hold 45 percent of the world oil reserves, and they secure 20 of the world oil market needs.

A prominent Gulf official told Agence France Presse that Saudi Arabia will call on the Cooperation Council to "form an economic and oil group that will have a united and strong stance during" international "negations" and "can throw its weight" in important decisions in oil markets.

OPEC failed to arrive at an agreement about an additional reduction of production last November and postponed taking any decisions on this for its next meeting in March 1999.
