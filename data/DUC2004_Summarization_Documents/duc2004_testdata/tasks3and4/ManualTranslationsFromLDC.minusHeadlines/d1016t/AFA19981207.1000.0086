Abu Dhabi 12-7 (AFP) - The Saudi Crown Prince, Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz, arrived today, Monday, in Abu Dhabi to participate in the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, on behalf of the Saudi monarch, King Fahad, as in the previous three years.
 
Abu Dhabi television showed images of Prince Abdullah upon arrival at the airport of the Emirates' capital.

The official Saudi News Agency had earlier announced that Prince Abdullah was dispatched by King Fahad to head the Saudi delegation at the 19th Gulf Cooperation Council Summit.

It should be noted that Prince Abdullah (75 years) is practically ruling Saudi Arabia due to the decline of King Fahad's health and that he took his place since 1995 in the annual summits of the Gulf Cooperation Council, that includes, besides Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the Emirates.

The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, and the Emir of Bahrain, Sheikh Issa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, also arrived today, Monday, in Abu Dhabi, as the official Emirates News Agency reported.
