Washington 12-21 (AFP) - Several opinion polls, the results of which were aired today, Monday, indicated that the majority of Americans is still supporting President Bill Clinton, despite the vote by the House of Representatives for his impeachment.

A poll conducted for "USA Today" and the "CNN" network showed that 73% of Americans are satisfied with the way Clinton is managing the country's affairs, a 10% increase in comparison with the last poll, which was conducted before the air strikes against Iraq and the impeachment vote on Saturday.

The poll, which was conducted by telephone with 852 adults, revealed that the number of those demanding the resignation of Clinton declined from 33% to 30%. 68% of people included in the poll contend that the Senate ought to refrain from convicting Clinton.

Another poll, which was conducted for the "Washington Post" Newspaper and the "ABC" network and included 1285 persons, revealed that only 42% of the people demanded Clinton's resignation early this week, while they were 57% at the end of last week.

A third study, which was conducted for the "New York Times" Newspaper, showed that two-thirds of Americans support Clinton's remaining in power until the end of his presidential term.
