Washington 10-8 (AFP) - An opinion poll conducted by the "USA Today" newspaper, in collaboration with the "CNN" television network and published today, Thursday, showed that the majority of Americans (53%) still oppose launching an official investigation that would be the first step in commencing President Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings.
 
The American House of Representatives is due to vote today, Thursday, on a resolution submitted by the Chairman of the Judicial Committee, Henry Hyde, asking Congress to launch an investigation over charges brought forward by Independent Prosecutor-General Kenneth Star against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
 
The poll also showed that a higher percentage of Americans (65%) believe that even if the investigation proceedings actually began, Clinton ought not to be removed.

The 65% result showed an improvement in comparison with a poll two organizations had earlier conducted two weeks ago, which showed that 63% of Americans support Clinton's staying as head of state.

On the other hand, 48% of those included in the poll think that Congress is not handling this case satisfactorily, but 53% of them believe that President Clinton deserves to be censured.

This opinion poll was conducted on the sixth and seventh of this October, and included a cross section of 861 adults with a margin of error estimated at 4%.
