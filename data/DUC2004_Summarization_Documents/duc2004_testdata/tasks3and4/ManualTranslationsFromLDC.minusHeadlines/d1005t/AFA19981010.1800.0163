New York 10-10 (AFP) - An opinion poll published by "Newsweek" magazine today, Saturday, showed that Americans are split over the possible outcome of President Clinton's fate resulting from the Congress' decision to vote on commencing the investigation to impeach him within the basis of the Lewinsky scandal.

While 31 percent of those included in the poll declared their support for the president's resignation, a similar percentage expressed the belief that Congress ought to be content with censuring Clinton before closing the file.

One American out of ten supported continuing the impeachment proceedings by the Congress, while 25 percent rejected the idea of taking any similar action.

51 percent expressed their belief that the pieces of evidence against Clinton are less serious than those levied against the late president Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation in the year 1974.

The poll showed that the percentage of Americans supporting the impeachment proceedings and Clinton's leaving the White House is equal to that which supported the same for Nixon during that era.

Nevertheless, 58 percent of Americans expressed their satisfaction for the president's job performance. 44 percent had supported Nixon's job performance immediately at the start of the investigation into Watergate.

The poll, which was conducted on the 8 and 9 of this month, covered 752 adult individuals.
