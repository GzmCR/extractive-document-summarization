Washington 12-8 (AFP) - Americans' firm opposition to impeaching President Bill Clinton is continuing, as reported by an opinion poll yesterday, Monday, before the vote by the Judicial Committee in the Senate in the coming days on its recommendations regarding this case.
  
Two thirds of Americans (66 percent) do not want President Clinton impeached, according to an opinion poll taken by the C.N.N. Network/U.S.A. Today Gallup. 64 percent were in favor of this opinion last November and 62 percent last October. 

Even 37 percent of those polled prefer that Congress call off this case, versus 33 percent who wish to get a censure vote against the president.  Those who support his impeachment constitute only 27 percent.

The poll indicated that 66 percent of Americans approve of Bill Clinton's performance in the White House.
 
Yet, 61 percent do not approve of the Judicial Committee's approach in conducting the investigation.

44 percent believe that Congress ought to amend the law that authorizes the Secretary of Justice to issue a recommendation to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate the activities of members of the government.

The poll, with a margin of error of 3 percent, included 1070 persons in the period from December 4 to 6.
