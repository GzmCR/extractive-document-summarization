Washington 12-19 (AFP) - An opinion poll published by the "New York Times" Newspaper and the American television network "CBS" showed a decline in the Republican Party's popularity to its lowest level in fourteen years.

The Republican Party's image deteriorated throughout the past week on the eve of voting on President Bill Clinton's impeachment. The poll showed that 33 percent of those included in the poll expressed their support for the Republicans versus 42 percent at the beginning of the week.

The newspaper confirmed that the decline is the worst since the year 1984. The Democratic Party's popularity remained stable by obtaining 56 percent of the votes of those polled.  

The poll indicated, on the other hand, that the majority of Americans (62 percent) opposes Clinton's impeachment. 65 percent approved of the way he is handling matters.
 
Nevertheless, four Americans out of ten supported the idea of the president's resignation in case the impeachment proceedings reached the trial stage in the Senate because that will be better for the country.

The poll, which included 1666 persons on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of last week, and included 326 others on Thursday following Clinton's decision to carry out strikes against Iraq.
