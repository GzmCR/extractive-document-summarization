Washington 12-12 (AFP) - An opinion poll broadcast by the "NBC" Network today, Saturday, showed that the majority of Americans (60%) still opposes impeaching President Bill Clinton because of his role in the Monica Lewinsky affair.  

Nevertheless, the percentage of Americans who support his departure rose by 11 points since the legislative elections that were held on the third of last month to reach 38%.

43% of Americans polled agreed with the ratification of the House of Representatives of the accusatory memorandum against the president.

The number of Americans (86%) who consider that Bill Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice rose (63%) to conceal his relationship with the former intern in the White House.
 
Yet, 56% of Americans think that lying in this regard is not considered sufficient evidence to impeach a president.

The majority of Americans (61%) prefer to officially censure the president, whose policy they still support (60%). A majority of them (58%) thinks that his last admission of his mistake via television yesterday evening did not change their position.

The poll was conducted yesterday evening and included 528 adult individuals, representing the American society. It includes a margin of error of 4.5 points.
