Washington 12-20 (AFP) - Several opinion polls, the results of which were aired today, Sunday, indicated that the majority of Americans still support American President Bill Clinton, despite the vote by the House of Representatives recommending his impeachment.
  
A poll conducted by the "NBC" television network showed that 72% of people included in the poll approve of Clinton's handling of his job performance, versus 68% five days ago.

62% contended that he should complete his term, an increase of 11 points from the previous poll.

The percentage of those who think the president ought to resign declined from 44% five days ago to 34% today.

Another poll, conducted for the "New York Times" Newspaper and the "CBS" television network, showed that the vote by the House of Representatives had little or no effect at all on the attitude of the general public towards Clinton.

66% opposed his resignation versus 31% who thought that it will be better for the country. These are the same two figures obtained in a poll, in which the results were aired a week ago.
 
Finally, 32% of those included in the poll thought a Clinton trial will take place in the Senate, while 66% said they would prefer reaching a settlement that allows avoiding a trial.
 
The "New York Times - CBS" poll included 499 persons with a margin of error determined at the rate of 4%. The "NBC" poll included 510 persons with a margin of error that reached 4.5%.
