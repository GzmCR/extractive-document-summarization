Pretoria 10-29 (AFP) - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended today, Thursday, to file lawsuits against those accused in its report of committing violations of human rights and who did not ask for amnesty, including former President Pieter Botha, the former wife of the Head of State Winnie Mandela, and the leader of the Zulu's Inkatha Party, Mangosuthu Buthelezi.

The recommendations submitted today, Thursday, to President Mandela by Monsignor Desmond Toto, the Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating human rights violations under the former apartheid regime, called for "rejecting the principle of general amnesty in any form it comes." 

The recommendations condemned the country's former president, Pieter Botha (82 years of age), in his capacity as Chairman of the National Security Council, and held him responsible for serious and blatant violations of human rights, including assassination of political opponents during his administration.

The recommendations affirmed that Botha's regime witnessed wide-scale violations of human rights committed by the police and army apparatus, and included acts of liquidation, kidnapping and torture, and that he exerted pressure on the security forces in order for them to "confront on a larger scale" opposition organizations, an expression interpreted as an invitation to kill.

The report accuses Botha personally of giving orders to destroy a building in Johannesburg that housed organizations opposed to apartheid.


The report held Winnie Mandela, the former wife of President Nelson Mandela, responsible for crimes committed by her personal security detail in the black city of Soweto at the end of the eighties, and that organizations she was overseeing committed acts of "murder, torture, assaults and setting off fires."

It said that Winnie Mandela's opponents "were considered informers and they were being liquidated."
  
The report made similar accusations against the leader of the Zulu's Inkatha Party, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the current Interior Minister.
