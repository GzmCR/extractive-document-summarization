Johannesburg 10-31 (AFP) - The "Saturday Star" newspaper, published today, Saturday, reported that the South African Vice President, Thabo Mbeki, decided to continue the efforts undertaken by the African National Congress for opposing the publication of the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission despite of President Nelson Mandela's agreement to publish it as is.
 
The paper quoted one of the South African president's advisors that "Thabo Mbeki made the decision in his capacity as President of the African National Congress and that Mandela made his contribution to the dialogue, but it was ignored.
 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report said in particular that the African National Congress committed considerable human rights violations during its struggle against the apartheid regime.

The paper explained that Mandela expressed relief for the report and expressed his hope for its publication "with all of its mistakes" and without deleting the paragraphs that discuss the African National Congress' camps in Angola where murders and torture were committed.
 
Yet, Mbeki denounced the Truth and Reconciliation Commission because it did not take into account the objections of the African National Congress, and it seems that publishing this report has caused divisions inside the party.
 
One of the National Congress' representatives said that filing a complaint by the president of the Congress with the legal authority is "a great foolishness", asserting that that it will tarnish the image of the party abroad and question its readiness to admit its past.

The paper stressed that Mbeki's stance enraged against him many members in the executive committee of the African National Congress, who found themselves compelled to call on the Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Bishop Desmond Toto, to apologize for the position of their party chairman.
  
Thabo Mbeki had been appointed to be Chairman of the African National Congress a year ago. Observers considered this a step he is taking toward the country's presidency since President Nelson Mandela, who is 80 years old, has announced that he will retire next year.
