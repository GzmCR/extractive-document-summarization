Pretoria 10-29 (AFP) - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which had investigated crimes committed in South Africa before abolishing apartheid, considers that apartheid constitutes "a crime against humanity."

The Commission added, in a report submitted in Pretoria to South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, "Although it was perfectly legal in South Africa, the apartheid regime was in contradiction with International Law."
