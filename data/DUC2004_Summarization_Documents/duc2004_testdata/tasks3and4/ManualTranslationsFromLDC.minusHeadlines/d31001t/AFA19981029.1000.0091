Pretoria 10-29 (AFP) - The President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, announced today, Thursday, that he "approves" the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report "as is, despite all the gaps in it."
  
After receiving the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report from its Chairman, Desmond Toto, the President of the State said, "Many will have reservations on many aspects included in the five volumes" the report is comprised of.
 
He added, "It will seem difficult for some to equate those who fought a just war with their adversaries in it."

Mandela said that it would also be difficult for the victims to accept "substituting penal justice with a peaceful transitional period". He went on to say, "It will also be very difficult for many to agree with the conclusion that the racist state was the first to commit blatant human rights violations."

Mandela concluded by saying that he "approves" the report "as is, with all of its gaps as a way for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to help us reconcile amongst ourselves and build our nation."
