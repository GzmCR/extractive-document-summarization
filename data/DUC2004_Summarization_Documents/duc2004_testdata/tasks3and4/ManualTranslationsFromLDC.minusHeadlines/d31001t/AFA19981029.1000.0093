Pretoria 10-29 (AFP) - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended today, Thursday, at the conclusion of a thirty-month investigation, legal actions against all those responsible for apartheid in South Africa starting with the former President Pieter Botha in addition to other political figures such as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
 
In its report, which was officially submitted to President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria today, Thursday, the Commission described apartheid as "a crime against humanity" and held the government of the National Party (the ruling party from 1948 to 1994) responsible for the atrocities that were committed between 1960 and 1994 in order to uphold the white minority rule.

Pieter Botha (82 years of age), who ruled the country from 1978 to 1989, was held primarily responsible for all legal persecutions (judicial convictions, political repression and propaganda) or illegal ones (murder, torture, mistreatment, cases of disappearances and secret military assaults...) against opponents of the apartheid regime.
 
All ministers and generals who were members in the State National Security Council (the supreme executive authority during the apartheid regime), just like Botha, were held responsible for "the systematic terror policy" and the victims it left behind.

Only the former Minister of Law and Order, Adrian Fluke, asked for amnesty.  All apartheid regime officials are facing the possibility of appearing before the courts in case their dossiers are referred to the legal system.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called on general prosecutors to "focus especially on police elements who committed acts of murder, torture or assault within as part of their duties."

The Commission's report, which summarizes in three thousand pages thousands of testimonies and official documents, condemned at the same time "human rights violations" that were committed during the struggle for liberation from the apartheid regime.
 
The African National Congress (the governing body since 1994), which tried till the last minute to prevent the issuance of the report, was held responsible for executions without trials and torture in concentration camps and was also responsible for acts of political violence witnessed by black cities in the early sixties.
 
This party, under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, asked for mass amnesty for 37 of its officials, but the name of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was not among them.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission held the former wife of the country's president "politically and morally" responsible for acts of killing, torture and other practices committed by elements of her personal group known as the "Mandela United Football Club" at the end of the eighties in Soweto.

The report included a surprise with its indication of the personal involvement of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, President of the Zulu's Inkatha Party and the current Interior Minister, in the apartheid regime.  Buthelezi prided himself during that period of his international reputation as a "moderate" opponent of the apartheid regime.
   
The report cast the opinion that the Inkatha Party, which has been participating in the government since 1994, "conspired with security forces" under the apartheid regime and was one of its "allies."

Buthelezi, who did not ask for amnesty, was held responsible for acts of violence witnessed by his stronghold KwaZulu-Natal and several black cities throughout the country which led to the killing of 4500 people between 1982 and 1994, a larger number of victims than that attributed to police.
 
The report also condemned the radical right and its leaders for violent campaigns that took place before the 1994 elections.

The report emphasized in conclusion that "the principle of a obtaining a general amnesty must be rejected regardless of what form it takes" and dedicated hundreds of pages for different ways "to achieve reconciliation within the ranks of the South African people."
