Johannesburg 10-26 (AFP) - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission asserted that the (ruling) African National Congress committed "serious violations of human rights" during its struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa.

This accusation came in a preliminary report prepared by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and which Agence France Presse received a copy of today, Monday.
 
The Commission's spokesman said in a statement to Agence France Press that the Commission will submit the report Thursday to the South African President Nelson Mandela.
 
The Commission, designated to shed light on crimes and human rights violations during the apartheid period, accuses the African National Congress of committing tortures and executions without trials in concentration camps and that it played an active role in the political violence incidents that took place between 1990 and 1994.
 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission's investigators the submitted the preliminary results of their work in early October to around 200 organizations and individuals to warn them of charges against them and to give them the opportunity to respond before final drafting of the report.

The seven pages directed against the African National Congress detail the violations committed in the Congress' camps in exile, and the executions ordered by "military tribunals."

The draft details 13 forms of mistreatment - like the one called "From Beirut", where the victim is subjected to forceful beating while naked and face down on the floor - as stated in the report that "the Commission recognizes that African National Congress' policy was not to force tortures, but it did resort to torture on a large scale between 1979 and 1989.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission held "the African National Congress responsible for fallen dead, attacks and aggressive acts against its political opponents", and for violent campaigns waged by its elements following the lifting of sanctions against the Congress in 1990.

Finally, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission asked the African National Congress to accept its responsibilities for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her militia that bears the name "the Mandela Football Club" and which planted fear in the black city of Soweto at the end of the eighties.  The former wife of the South African president did not ask for amnesty, and her activities were not listed in the political reports submitted by the African National Congress to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996 and 1997.
 
National African Congress spokesman, Thabo Mabado, told Agence France Presse that the Congress received these preliminary remarks and responded to them in time. He said, "We hope that this response is duly taken into consideration."
