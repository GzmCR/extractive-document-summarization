Johannesburg 10-28 (AFP) - The African National Congress resorted today, Wednesday, to the legal system in order to avoid being accused in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report, which will be officially published tomorrow.
 
President Nelson Mandela's party wants, according to a statement, to "prevent the publication of paragraphs from the report accusing the African National Congress of human rights violations" committed during the struggle against the apartheid regime.

Former President Frederick De Klerk had earlier resorted to the legal system, which decided to delete his name from this report before it is officially submitted to Mandela tomorrow, Thursday.
