Pretoria 10-29 (AFP) - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended in its report, which was submitted today, Thursday, to South African President Nelson Mandela, to file law suits against officials for human rights violations in case they are not granted amnesty.
 
The following is a list of the main suspects (organizations and personnel): - The state (the government and civil and military administrations): + Held responsible for its racial policy aiming at protecting the white minority and because of all legal proceedings (judicial convictions, political persecution and propaganda) and for illegal ones (murder, torture, mistreatment, disappearances, secret military assaults and operations in neighboring countries...).

- Members of the State National Security Council (the supreme executive authority in the apartheid regime), starting with President Pieter Botha and including all ministers and officials of the army and police; they were being held responsible because "they purposely planned" for human rights violations via the call to "cleanse" the opponents "and get rid of them".  Secondly, they are responsible for the death of people who fell victims to their policy.
 
- Pieter Botha (82 years of age), the country's former president: + Held responsible for all acts of violence committed by the state when he was the country's president from 1978 to 1989.

Botha, who was nicknamed "The Big Crocodile" by South Africans, was held responsible for issuing orders to the attack the headquarters of the South African Congress of Churches (one of the main organizations in the movements opposed to the apartheid regime) in the year 1988.  He refused to cooperate with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and did not ask for amnesty.
 
- Frederick De Klerk (64 years of age), the last white president of South Africa: + Paragraphs dealing with him were withdrawn after he filed a complaint with the judicial authorities for libel and slander. The Cape Supreme Court will decide on this case next March. 

- The African National Congress (the governing body since 1994): + Held responsible for terror campaigns that led to killing of civilians, for acts of violence that targeted persons considered informers or traitors, and for executions without trials, acts of torture in concentration camps and acts of political violence between blacks that preceded the 1994 elections.
 
- Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (64 years of age), a representative of the African National Congress: + The former wife of the president was held "politically and morally" responsible for acts of violence committed by people close to her at the end of the eighties in the black city of Soweto. She was accused that "she had knowledge" of the "involvement" of her "private armed group" known as the "Mandela United Football Club" in acts of killing, torture, assaults and deliberate fires, but she "intentionally chose not to act."

Individuals who were confronting her or confronting the people close to her were regarded as "informers" which made them "legitimate targets." She kept asserting that she works in the name of her party, the African National Congress, while she was not disclosing her practices to this party.

- The African Congress (the radical black left): + Held responsible for killings against white farmers before the 1994 elections and for practices committed in concentration camps.

- Inkatha (Zulu National Party): + Held responsible for acts of violence committed at its stronghold in KwaZulu-Natal and in various black cities throughout the country while adopting "a systematic policy" calling for killing and attacking opponents.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission affirmed that this party worked in collusion with government security forces "and it is one of the government's historical allies."

The Commission considered that this party caused the killing of 3800 people between 1982 and 1994, while the African National Congress caused the killing of 1100 people in the KwaZulu-Natal region alone. On the national front, Zulu activists killed 4500 people as compared to 2700 by the police and 1300 by the African National Congress.

- Mangosuthu Buthelezi (70 years of age), Minister of Internal Affairs and leader of the Inkatha Party: + Held responsible for all acts of violence committed by the Inkatha Party in his capacity as leader of the party and a former local official in KwaZulu region.  He did not testify before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission nor did he ask for amnesty.

- The Radical Right: + Held responsible between 1993 and 1994 for instigating violence, for concentrating attacks on political opponents to create an atmosphere of instability and for banning the first multi-ethnic elections.
 
- Constand Philiwin, leader of the Freedom Party (Afrikaan National), 64 years of age: + Held responsible for human rights violations because of violent acts committed by the radical right.

- Eugene Terblanch, leader of the New Nazi Afrikaan Resistance Party (57 years of age): + Held responsible for human rights violations because of violent acts committed by the radical right.
