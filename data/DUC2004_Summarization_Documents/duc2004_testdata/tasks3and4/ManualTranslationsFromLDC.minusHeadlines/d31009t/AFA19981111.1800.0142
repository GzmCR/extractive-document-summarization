Ankara 11-11 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz ruled out his government's resignation in the aftermath of information disclosed by businessman, Korkmaz Yigit, accusing him of overlooking his relationship with a Turkish Mafia boss when he bought the Turkish Commercial Bank.
 
Yilmaz said in a brief press conference, "I absolutely do not think about resigning", calling these accusations "a conspiracy aiming at preventing his government from confronting the Mafia and the criminal organizations" in Turkey.

Yigit had disclosed in a recorded tape aired last evening, Tuesday, aired via two television channels he owns, his relationships with a Mafia boss detained in France, named Alaattin Cakici.

Yigit explained in the tape that the Prime Minister and Minister of State for the Economy, Gunes Taner, knew about this relationship when Yigit bought the state-owned Turkish Commercial Bank last July for 600 million dollars.
 
Opposition political parties demanded Yilmaz's resignation yesterday, following the airing of this tape.

Yilmaz added that "confronting a conspiracy aiming at blackmailing my government does not require resignation at all. On the contrary, my government is determined to confront the Mafia affiliates till the end."

He said that "fighting Mafia activities is a very difficult task, and it requires a determined government and a responsible opposition."
