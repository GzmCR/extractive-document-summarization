Ankara 12-21 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister-Designate Bulent Ecevit officially announced today, Monday, giving up the task of forming the government after his efforts in that regard have failed.

Ecevit said at the conclusion of a brief meeting with President Suleiman Demirel, "I have given up the task of forming the new government that the president designated to me."

Demirel had designated Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party (nationalistic leftist), to form the new government on the second of December after the Parliament ousted the government of Mesut Yilmaz on 25 November due to "his ties with the Mafia."

Ecevit explained to reporters, "I have proposed during my consultations with the political party leaders three coalition formulas, a minority coalition or one that enjoys a majority, excluding the (Islamic) Virtue Party, but I did not get the support that guarantees me a majority in the Parliament."

He blamed his failure particularly on the leader of the Republican People's Party (socialist democratic), Deniz Baykal, his rival for the leadership of the Turkish left, and said, "Baykal vehemently opposed the formation of a government under my leadership."
 
The Islamic Virtue Party is the most represented party in Parliament in which it occupies 144 seats out of a total of 550 seats. The party's Secretary-General, Ayyoub Sanai, demanded yesterday, Sunday, that he be designated to form the new government and said in a press conference in Ankara that "the president of the republic must designate the task of forming the new government to our party."

The Virtue Party replaced the Welfare Party, which brought about the wrath of the army, protector of secularism, and that of pro-secularism groups, when its leader, Necmettin Erbakan, ruled the country from June 1996 to June 1997 as the head of a government coalition with former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's party.
