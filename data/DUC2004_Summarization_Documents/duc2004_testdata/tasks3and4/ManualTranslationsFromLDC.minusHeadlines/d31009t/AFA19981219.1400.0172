Ankara 12-19 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister-Designate, Bulent Ecevit, announced today, Saturday, that efforts he exerted to form a new government have failed, and that he will resign the task assigned to him by President Suleiman Demirel next Monday.

Ecevit said, "I have asked the president to receive me on Monday morning in order for me to submit my resignation."

President Demirel had designated Ecevit, who is 73 years of age and is the leader of the Democratic Left Party, to form a new government on the second of this month after the Parliament ousted Mesut Yilmaz due to "his relation with the Mafia."

Ecevit, one of the most senior Turkish politicians, was unable to secure the necessary support from the parties represented in the Parliament in order to form his government.
