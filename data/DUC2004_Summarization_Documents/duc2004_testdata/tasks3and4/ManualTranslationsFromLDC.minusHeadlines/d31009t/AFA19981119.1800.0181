Ankara 11-19 (AFP) - Turkish parliamentary sources announced that the Turkish Parliament included on its agenda this evening, Thursday, memoranda to withhold confidence from Mesut Yilmaz's government by a majority of 311 votes against 213 votes with the charge of "establishing secret ties with Mafia affiliates." Such memoranda may lead to the fall of the government next week.

Three parties that enjoy the absolute majority, or 276 votes, inside the Parliament, which is the required majority to unseat the government, submitted these memoranda. These parties are the True Path Party (rightist), which is led by Tansu Ciller, the Virtue Party (Islamist) and the Republican People's Party (socialist democratic), led by Deniz Baykal who withdrew his support for the government.

Yasin Hatipoglu, who presided over the session, announced that the Parliament would discuss the confidence-withholding memoranda next Monday before eventually voting on adopting or rejecting them.
 
Opposition parties accuse Yilmaz's coalition government, which includes three parties but does not enjoy the majority of votes inside the Parliament, of "exceeding authority and establishing secret ties with Mafia affiliates."
