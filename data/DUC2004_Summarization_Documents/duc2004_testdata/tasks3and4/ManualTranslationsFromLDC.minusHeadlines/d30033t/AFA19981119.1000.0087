Paris 11-19 (AFP) - French Economy Minister, Dominique Strauss Kahn, said that France has minted one billion Euro coins at its monetary establishment in Pessac (southwestern France).

The number of one billion was reached on November 18, a little more than six months after the start of the European currency-minting program last May 11.

It is planned that by the end of the year 2001, France would have minted 7.6 billion Euro coins weighing 30 thousand tons or approximately four times the equivalent weight of the Eiffel Tower.
