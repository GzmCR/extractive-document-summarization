Brussels 1-1 (AFP) - The unified European currency (the Euro) became this morning, Friday, since 00:00 (23:00 GMT) the official currency for 291 million Europeans in eleven countries out of fifteen in the European Union.

Thus, the eleven countries in the Euro region, which are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Austria, Portugal, Finland and Ireland, now have a unified currency.
 
National currencies, which are the French franc, the Deutsch mark, the Belgian franc, the Luxemburg franc, the florin, the Italian lire, the Irish punt, the peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Austrian schilling and the Finish mark, became branch currencies for the Euro.
 
There are some four countries in the European Union, which did not participate at the present time in the monetary union, and they are Britain, Denmark, Greece and Sweden.
 
Because of the time difference, Finland was the first to enter the Euro region yesterday, Thursday, at 22:00 GMT, while Portugal and Ireland entered today, Friday, at 00:00 GMT, an hour after the other eight European countries.

The European Finance Ministers had ratified Thursday afternoon the exchange rates of the eleven European currencies against the Euro as announced by the European Commission. 

Upon publication of the national currency rates in the eleven countries relative to the Euro, tens of thousands of people were mobilized in the European financial markets to convert stock prices to Euro before markets open on Monday, and the Euro will be priced relative to the other currencies.
 
Yet, individuals will not obtain the Euro's seven banknotes and eight coins before the first of January 2002, and they will continue to use the franc, the Deutsche mark and peseta, for example, to pay for their purchases, but they will be able to gradually use the Euro via checks or bank card, or via transfers.
