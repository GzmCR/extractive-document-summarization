Paris 12-3 (AFP) - Central banks in the countries that will adopt the single European currency (Euro) announced today, Thursday, a sudden and agreed-upon reduction in the prime interest rates, particularly in France and Germany, which reduced this rate by 0.3% to become 3%.

Excluding Italy, which restored the discount rate from 4% to 3.5%, all other central banks adopted the 3% rate. Austria reduced its rate by 0.2 points; Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg by 0.3 points; Finland 0.4; Spain 0.5; Ireland 0.65; and Portugal 0.75.
  
The chief of the German Central Bank (Bundesbank), Hans Tietmeyer, justified this measure by the early signs of economic slowdown, affecting the countries which will adopt the Euro.  The chief of the European Central Bank, Vim Duesenburg, had spoken two days ago about "doubtless" signs of a growth slowdown.
