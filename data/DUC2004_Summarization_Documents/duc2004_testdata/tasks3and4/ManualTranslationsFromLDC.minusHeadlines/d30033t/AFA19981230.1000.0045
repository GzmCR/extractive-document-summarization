Paris 12-30 (AFP) - The Euro banknotes, which will be in Europeans' wallets in the year 2002, will not bear traditional images of famous people, but will bear geometrical drawings representing openness and communication. As for the national symbols unique to each country, they were limited to a single side of the future coins.
 
The design of the Euro banknotes of the 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 denominations was inspired from the "eras and designs in Europe" theme. It was selected after a European competition was held, which the artist Robert Callina from the Austrian Central Bank had won. The new currency bears the geometric drawings of seven consecutive eras of European civilization starting with the classic era and ending with the twentieth century architecture, which was noted for its use of metal and glass.
 
According to the official introduction at the Euro's web site, imaginary windows and doors representing the "mysticism of openness and cooperation within the European Union appear on the front side of the banknotes. On the back side, there is a bridge representing a certain era "as a symbol for communication between Europe's peoples and between Europe and the rest of the world."

The smallest banknote is the 5-Euro denomination, which is gray in color, followed by the pink 10 denomination, the blue 20, the orange 50, the green 100 and the yellow 200. The largest denomination is that of the 500 banknote, which represents the more modern era and will be lilac in color.

There will be no distinguishing national marks on the Euro banknotes, which will be identical in all of the Euro region countries.

The word "Euro" will be printed in large lettering followed by the same word in Greek lettering.

Coins (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 centime then one and two Euros) will have a uniform side and the other side will be determined according to the wishes of each country. Austria selected flowers from the Alps mountains or historical buildings for some coins. The Italian currency will honor artists and statues. France will remain faithful to the symbols of the republic.
  
Despite these differences, nothing prevents a Portuguese, for example, from buying a sandwich in front of the Eiffel Tower with an Euro coin bearing the Austrian flowers.

The Euro will also have its own symbol which is the letter "E" crossed by two parallel lines, just like the symbols of the dollar and the yen.
