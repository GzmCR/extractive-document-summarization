Paris 12-3 (AFP) - Central banks in the countries that will adopt the single European currency (Euro) announced today, Thursday, a sudden and agreed-upon reduction in the prime interest rates, particularly in France and Germany, which reduced this rate by 0.3% to become 3%.

Excluding Italy, which restored the discount rate from 4% to 3.5%, all other central banks adopted the 3% rate. Austria reduced its rate by 0.2 points; Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg by 0.3 points; Finland 0.4; Spain 0.5; Ireland 0.65; and Portugal 0.75.

The chief of the German Central Bank (Bundesbank), Hans Tietmeyer, justified this measure by the early signs of economic slowdown, affecting the countries which will adopt the Euro. The chief of the European Central Bank, Vim Duesenburg, had spoken two days ago about "doubtless" signs of growth slowdown, following the financial crises that shook Asia then the rest of the developing countries since 18 months ago. 

Economic experts were surprised with this coordinated reduction of interest rates; they were expecting, before the meetings of officials in the German Central Bank and French Central Bank today, that the two main central banks in the Euro countries would not reduce interest rates this week.

Michael Metcalf, the economic expert from "NatWest Global Financial Markets" in London declared, "These reductions came before the time we expected."
   
Most analysts consider that the recent economic statistics in major Euro region countries justifies such a measure.

Nick Parsons, an economic expert at "Paribas Capital Markets" company in London, said that "this measure will decrease the difficulties that may accompany the start of dealing "with the Euro", and added that "the Euro will consequently become a strong and stable currency."
  
The Chairman of the German Central Bank indicated that the decision did not come as a result of political pressures exerted by the German Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine.
 
He thought that there are no signs of economic sluggishness in Europe, but at the same time admitted that "early signs of an economic slowdown affected the Euro region." He added that the international financial crises have not been surpassed yet.
