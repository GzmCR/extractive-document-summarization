Cairo 11-16 (AFP) - Two Egyptian lawyers decided to resort to the law to ask for an astronomical compensation from the weekly Sunday Telegraph Newspaper, which they accuse of publishing false information on persecuting the Copts in Egypt.

Moslem attorney Nabil Al-Wahsh told Agence France Presse that he and his Coptic colleague Mamdouh Nakhla filed a complaint with the Cairo Court demanding the payment of 15 thousand dollars to each one of Egypt's citizens who are numbered at 65 million. He added that the complaint will be reviewed starting next January 14.

The same court is due to review next December 9 another complaint against the British newspaper filed on November 2 by 80 Moslem and Coptic celebrities, demanding compensations valued at 17 billion dollars.
 
Al-Wahsh acknowledged that the asking figure is astronomical and said, "What's important is not the compensation sum, but that justice prevail," adding that a conviction "will muzzle the mouths that say there is a sectarian problem in Egypt."

The British newspaper had affirmed last October 25 that police forces committed "crucifixion and rape" against a number of Copts during a campaign in Al-Koshah village in the countryside last August 14.

The Egyptian authorities denounced this article, and President Hosni Mubarak accused Israel of implicitly standing behind a biased campaign aiming at hurting his country.

Al-Wahsh is renowned for filing compensatory lawsuits against several world celebrities, such as the American President Bill Clinton for imposing sanctions against Libya and King Elizabeth whom he accused of standing behind the death of Princess Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed.
