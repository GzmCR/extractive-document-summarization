Cairo 11-2 (AFP) - An Egyptian lawyer filed a lawsuit today, Monday, on behalf of 80 Copts, against the British "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper, demanding that it pay 10 billion pounds sterling (17 billion dollars) as compensation for publishing "false news on the persecution of Copts in Egypt."
  
A legal source said that the Compensation Department at South Cairo Court set next December 9 as a date to look into the case. 

The source added that Attorney Mustafa Ashoub, who obtained the representation of 80 Copts, asked the newspaper for compensation for "the material and moral damages inflicted upon the people of Egypt, Copts and Moslems", due to the publication of an article that included "false news" on "crucifying and raping Copts in Egypt."

Ashoub contended in his lawsuit that the aim of the article published by the "Sunday Telegraph" last October 25 is "to tarnish Egypt's reputation, destabilize the nation and plant discord and hatred among its people."
 
The lawyer said that the compensation funds will be used especially for financing projects to improve women's conditions in Egypt's countryside, where Al-Koshah village is located and whose residents, as the Telegraph article affirmed, were subjected to savage torture at the hands of Egyptian police in the aftermath of a capital murder that left two Copt victims.

The article, headlined "Egyptian Police Crucify, Rape Christians" in the village located in the Sohag Governance, had caused such an outrage within Egyptian circles to the point that propelled President Hosni Mubarak to call what was reported in the article as "slurs" and to accuse Israel yesterday, Sunday, of "implicitly" standing behind a campaign targeting Egypt. 
 
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, in turn, expressed in a statement received by Agence France Presse today its "concern" regarding the British newspaper's article and "its allegations" about subjecting thousands of Copts in the Al-Koshah village to crucifixion and torture because of their religious identity.  

The organization expressed its concern for using a human rights cause "for political reasons", affirming that the fact-finding mission it dispatched to the village confirmed that the "violations" did not target Copts as a religious minority.

The organization added that since its founding in 1985, "it did not register any violations committed by the security services against Coptic citizens for religious reasons."

The organization had published last September 28 a lengthy report in which it contended that 1200 of the village's Coptic residents were subjected to "arbitrary detention and torture" at the hands of Egyptian police.

The report detailed, according to testimonies by citizens, several cases of torture where "beating, electric shock, hanging from a ceiling fan and detention for several days" were employed.

The "Center for Human Rights for Aiding Prisoners" had also confirmed in a statement that the violations the village's residents, "Copts and Moslems",  were subjected to at the hands of several police officers "were not attributed to religious persecution but rather to an officer's excesses while investigating a capital murder."
 
The weekly "Watani" newspaper, which reflects the Coptic Church's viewpoint, reported yesterday, Sunday, that it was still awaiting the response of the Interior Minister, Habib Al-Adli, to its request to open an investigation in the events of Al-Koshah (500 kilometers south of Cairo).

The newspaper wrote in its editorial opening, "We have not received the anticipated response, nor has any official statement been issued" since the addressing of "a plea to the Interior Minister calling on him to investigate the excesses which we were informed are being committed in the above-mentioned village (...) and to clarify the truth."

In turn, the Egyptian lawyer Nabih Al Wahsh, renowned for suing celebrities, announced to Agence France Presse today, Monday, that he is waiting for the "Sunday Telegraph's" response to the warning he issued against it, and which expires tomorrow, Tuesday, to publish an apology for its article on the village under the threat of suing it.
