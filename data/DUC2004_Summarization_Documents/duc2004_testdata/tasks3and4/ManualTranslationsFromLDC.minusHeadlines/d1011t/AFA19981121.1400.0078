Cairo 11-21 (AFP) - "Al Kalema" Center for Advocating Human Rights asked the Egyptian authorities today, Saturday, to pay 1.5 million dollars, as compensations "for torture victims" of Copts at a village in the countryside.
 
The center's director, Coptic Attorney Mamdouh Nakhla, explained in a statement that the center filed a lawsuit against the Interior Minister and the Security Chief of Sohag demanding the payment of five million Egyptian pounds (1.5 million dollars) for the victims who were tortured at Al-Koshah village in the Sohag Governance.
    
The Egyptian Organization for Advocating Human Rights had mentioned in a report it published on September 28 that the police detained in August 1200 of Al-Koshah's residents and tortured a number of them the day after the murder of two Coptic young men.
 
On the sixth of November, the Copts' Patriarch, Pope Shnouda III, confirmed that a number of Copts were subjected "to assaults" by the police in Al-Koshah.
 
The Pope expressed relief for the decision of the Interior Minister, Habib Al-Adli, on the fifth of November to transfer four officers in the police to administrative positions, after the Egyptian Organization for Advocating Human Rights accused them of committing torture in this village.

On the ninth of November, seven human rights advocacy organizations called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to punish those responsible for these excesses.
