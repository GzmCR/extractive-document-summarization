Cairo 12-9 (AFP) - The Egyptian justice system reviewed today, Wednesday, a complaint filed by a number of Copts who are asking the weekly British "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper for an enormous compensation in the amount of 16 billion dollars for publishing an article on persecuting Christian Copts in Egypt.

The South Cairo Elementary Court reviewed today, Wednesday, the complaint filed by Attorney Mustafa Ashoub on behalf of 80 Copts and 20 Moslems. 

Attorney Ashoub said in his argument, "The issue is a conspiracy to destabilize Egypt by alleging that there is a sectarian subversion whereby the Sunday Telegraph Newspaper circulated this lie to harm Egypt and the people of Egypt."

The lawyer demanded on behalf of his clients a sum in the amount of 10 billion pounds sterling (16 billion dollars), contending that "a benefit exists for the allegers because the claim of persecuting Copts in Egypt is a lie aimed at dividing the citizens of this nation and destroying its basic edifice."
   
The complainants announced that they will use the compensations for the benefit of charities.
 
The court postponed the case to December 30 to enable the complainants to submit a full translation of the article published by the British newspaper.

The newspaper had said in its issue published on October 25 that the police "raped and crucified" Copts during a raid operation carried out on August 14 in Al-Koshah village, which is located in Egypt's countryside.
