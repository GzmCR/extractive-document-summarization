Cairo 11-9 (AFP) - Seven Egyptian human rights organizations issued a plea today, Monday, to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to hold accountable those responsible for the acts of torture that targeted residents of a village in Egypt's countryside while investigating two capital murders last August.
 
These organizations demanded in a statement the formation of "a commission to refer those responsible for (crimes of torture) to the appropriate judicial authorities, hold high-ranking officials who committed conspiracy accountable, and apologize to the people for the collective punishment, torture, material, physical and psychological damages inflicted upon them and compensate them."
  
The statement also demanded that Interior Minister Habib Al-Adli explain the delay in "conducting an investigation inside his ministry with the officers responsible for the Al-Koshah village events, despite the passage of three months since these crimes were committed."
 
The seven organizations accused the Interior Ministry of negligence in carrying out its duties, contending that the Prosecutor-General's office did investigate the torture events "and proved some in its accounts", yet, the Interior Minister, after 12 weeks, was content with transferring some of the officers in order not to influence the investigations."
 
The Interior Minister had transferred four high-ranking officers at the Al-Balina Station, Al-Koshah's jurisdiction, from their positions to administrative positions and promised to take decisive measures in case the torture events were proved in the investigations.
 
The officers' names were reported in testimonies of men, women and children subjected to torture, as were published in a report by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights last September 28. The report confirmed that police detained, in the aftermath of two capital murders in mid August, 1200 of the village residents, mostly Copts, and that tens of those were subjected to arbitrary detention and torture, exemplified in "hanging for long hours in mid air, tying in odd positions like a roasted lamb, stumping on bodies that are lying on the floor in such a brutal way that made some of them urinate or defecate involuntarily, beating by hand, foot and other means, and shocking with electricity in different parts including the genitals."
 
The human rights organizations expressed "their bewilderment for the hysterical jolt that struck the authorities of such a gallant country as Egypt due to an article in a foreign newspaper whilst they did not twitch a vein for the actual barbaric crimes committed against their citizens in this village, and instead of embarking on enforcing lawful punishment as mandated by the constitution and human rights charters, they directed most of their energies, inside Egypt and abroad, toward confronting a fabricated danger against the homeland."
 
Al-Koshah events had surfaced after the British "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper published an article last October 25 in which it accused the Egyptian police of "crucifying and raping Copts." Instantly, statements were intensified to deny such charges, especially by the Egyptian president and the Copts' Patriarch in Egypt, Pope Shnouda III.
 
As for holding those responsible for Al-Koshah events accountable, the human rights organizations demanded the formation of a commission from the Egyptian People's Congress to investigate various incidents of torture that were detailed in Egyptian human rights organizations' reports.

The statement bore the signatures of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, the Cairo Center for Human Rights Studies, the Democracy Development Society, the Center for Legal Aid for Human Rights, the Center of Human Rights for Aiding Prisoners, the Arab Center for Judges and Lawyers Independence, and the Arab Human Rights Activists Program.
