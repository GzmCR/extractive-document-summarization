Geneva 11-26 (AFP) - An informed source in Bern confirmed today, Thursday, that Barazan Al-Takriti, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother and former Ambassador to the United Nations, is ready to return to Baghdad at the end of this month.
 
The spokesman for the Swiss Federal Bureau for Refugees, Christoph Mueller, told Agence France Presse, "We have information from confirmed sources that Al-Takriti, is getting ready to leave Switzerland to Baghdad on the 30 of this month."    

The spokesman explained that the former ambassador, whose wife died from an acute illness a short while ago, obtained guarantees to return to Switzerland to visit his children who will stay there.

Barazan has eight children, some of whom are studying in Switzerland. They had earlier filed, together with their mother, an application for residency that is still under review.

The Swiss Foreign Ministry, in turn, announced today that it did not receive an application to extend Barazan's residency.
  
On the fifth of last August, Barazan, who assumed his post in Geneva in February 1989, notified the Swiss authorities that his mission will end at the end of this very month. Bern could then only allow him to stay till the end of the current month.
 
Barazan had declared to the Saudi "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat" Newspaper his desire to stay in Switzerland for family reasons following his transfer to Baghdad as part of a diplomatic reorganization move ordered by the Iraqi president.
