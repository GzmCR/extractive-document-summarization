Nicosia 10-1 (AFP) - It was learned from informed Iraqi sources in the region that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother, Barazan Al-Takriti, Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, refused to return to Baghdad which had recalled him.
  
Al-Takriti had been transferred together with 17 Iraqi ambassadors abroad to Baghdad as part of a diplomatic reorganization move announced by the official Iraqi newspaper +Babel+.
  
The ambassadors were first given until September 30 to return to Iraq, but the interval was extended until October 31, according to the clarification of the same Iraqi sources.

These sources indicate that Barazan Al-Takriti, who has occupied his position as Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva since 15 February 1989, is in dispute with Oday, the Iraqi president's eldest son and his former son-in-law. They add that he has not visited Iraq since 1990 for fear for his life.
  
According to the Iraqi sources, Barazan Al-Takriti's daughter, Suja, had taken refuge with her father in Geneva shortly after her marriage to Oday because of the mistreatment she was receiving.
 
Sources close to Al-Takriti had confirmed in August 1995 that he dissented like Hussein Kamel Hassan, the Iraqi president's son-in-law, and his brother Saddam who fled to Jordan, but Barazan Al-Takriti denied these reports at the time.

It should be noted that the Iraqi president, whose father died when he was very young, has four half-brothers from his mother who married his uncle.
