Geneva 11-29 (AFP) - The Swiss News Agency reported that Iraq's former Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Barazan AL-Takriti, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother, left Switzerland today, Sunday, heading to Amman.
 
Al-Takriti, who boarded a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane, said that he is heading to Baghdad, and denied the existence of a disagreement with his brother.
 
The former ambassador, whose wife died recently of cancer, obtained a guarantee before his departure that he may return to Switzerland to visit his children who will continue to reside there.
 
Barazan Al-Takriti has eight children including six who are continuing their studies in Switzerland. They filed, together with their mother, applications for residency that are still under review.

Al-Takriti had notified the United Nations on the fifth of August that his mission will end at the end of that very month, after he had occupied his post since 1989. The Swiss Foreign Ministry had allowed him to stay in Geneva till the end of November.
 
Barazan, who was included in broad diplomatic reorganization move carried out by the Iraqi government a few days ago, told a Saudi newspaper that he is hoping to remain in Switzerland for family reasons.
 
But other press reports explained that the former ambassador refused earlier to return to Iraq because of his disagreement with his brother's son, Oday Saddam Hussein.
