Damascus 11-30 (AFP) - Syrian voters headed in heavy numbers to the polling boxes today, Monday, to elect a new parliament that is expected to be dominated, as its predecessor was, by the Progressive National Front led by President Hafez Al-Assad.

Deputy Interior Minister Ahmad Hilal told Agence France Press that "the turnout was high in Damascus and reached a very high rate in the governances", but he did not specify the voters rates.

Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam, in turn, told reporters during a tour he took in the polling offices that the "election process was proceeding without interventions or pressures" exerted on the voters or the candidates.

Khaddam applauded the "democratic" process pointing to "the large numbers of young people among the candidates, which is a good sign and it ought to revitalize the political life in Syria.

The polling offices, where 6.6 million voters were urged to participate in, opened at eight o'clock in the morning local time and will close at eight o'clock in the evening.  The voting time was extended till two o'clock Tuesday afternoon.

An Agence France Presse's correspondent noted that independent candidates representatives, mostly students, who crowded the entrances of schools, administrative offices and factories turned into polling offices, surrounded voters who flocked in the tens to convince them to vote for their candidates and to give them lists that include their names.
 
About 7400 candidates are competing for 250 seats in the Parliament, but victory of the Progressive National Front's 167 candidates is virtually assured, which leaves no recourse for "the independent" candidates but to attain the rest of the seats numbered at 83.

Voters can select between lists that include the names of candidates of the Progressive National Front, which is the ruling coalition consisting of seven parties led by the Baath, and there is no difference between lists except for their inclusion of one or two names of independents which complete them.
  
One diplomat said in Damascus that "the only surprise of the elections will be to find out about the winner from the independents because the National Front's candidates will certainly win their seats."
 
The last general elections in August 1994 witnessed the triumph of 167 National Front's candidates and 83 independents, most of whom are affluent businessmen who presented non-detailed programs.

The election process took place amidst atmospheres of joy. Musical bands, spread out in front of the polling centers, played patriotic tunes welcoming voters and Syrian officials who checked on the progress of elections.

A lawyer asserted that he gave his vote to businessman Riyadh Saif because of "the slogans he raised only." It is rare to find candidates who presented clear programs.

Saif, the representative whose term is expiring, was known during Parliament sessions for his positions of strongly defending the market economy and demanding economic reforms.

Another representative said that he voted in favor of Actor Mahmoud Jabr because of his repeated demand to raise public sector employees' wages.
 
The massive number of banners hung over street intersections amid President Hafez Al-Assad's pictures and advertisements confused car drivers in Damascus.

A Syrian student commented jokingly, "Look, they hung their banners on this hotel and now we arecconfusing election slogans with advertisements for the "new Beaujolais" wine.
