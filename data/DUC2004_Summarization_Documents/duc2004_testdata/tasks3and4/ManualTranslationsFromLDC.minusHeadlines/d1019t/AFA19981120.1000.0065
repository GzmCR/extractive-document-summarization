Damascus 11-20 (AFP) - 7364 candidates are competing in the legislative elections which takes place this November 30 in Syria to select 250 members in the Syrian People's Congress for a four-year term.

The polling process is conducted in a single round on the basis of the list and by majority and includes 15 governances.

Interior Minister Mohammad Harba announced that 4237 candidates are competing for 127 seats allocated to farmers and laborers while the rest of the candidates are competing to win 123 seats allocated to other classes of people.

The Progressive National Front, which encompasses seven parties led by the ruling Socialist Baath Party, is entering the elections with a list that includes 167 candidates, as in previous elections.

Diplomats in Damascus thought that the Progressive National Front's list "enjoys all chances of winning" this time as in the six previous legislative elections that were held in Syria since the assumption of President Hafez Al-Assad to power 28 years ago.

It should be noted that during the last legislative elections in August 1994, the ruling coalition in Syria gained 167 seats while the independent representatives gained the remaining 83 seats.

Among the independent candidates is a large number of prominent merchants, businessmen and free-lancers.
 
Pictures of the candidates and supporting banners can be seen in the public squares and streets of Damascus. Yet, the majority of their election programs is general and not too specific. 
 
The candidates are organizing election meetings, and they receive voters daily.

Among the few candidates who publicized detailed election programs is Representative Riyadh Saif, whose term is expiring. Among the detail highlights of the program of Saif, a fifty-two year old businessman, are "working to achieve a higher degree of freedom of expression, eradicating unemployment, reforming the economy and helping the disabled."
 
Saif expressed to Agence France Presse the hope that he will be able to achieve much of his demands "because I feel the existence of a political will (by officials) to exploit the country's assets and human resources."

The other candidate, Arif Hananu, asserts in a program published by Damascus' three official newspapers that he will work "to improve wages, raise the standard of living, reduce taxes for the working class and pay more attention to social issues."

A third candidate was distinguished by announcing a curious pledge which is "to work for wholesome music."

Outside of the Progressive National Front, are a few candidates from political parties, such as the physician Basil Dahdouh, a member of the former congress who represents the Syrian Nationalist Party, which is an Arab secular party.

The official newspapers publish many articles on the election meetings held by the ruling party's candidates.

The number of voters in Syria is 6.6 million voters out of 15 million people.

The law requires the cessation of all election campaigns 48 hours before the start of the polling process.
