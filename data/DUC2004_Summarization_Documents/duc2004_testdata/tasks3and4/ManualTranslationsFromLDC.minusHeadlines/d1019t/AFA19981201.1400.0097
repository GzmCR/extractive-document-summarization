Damascus 12-1 (AFP) - The polling process to elect a new parliament in Syria, expected to be dominated by candidates of the authority's parties, was concluded today, Tuesday, with calls for economic reform.

Polling offices, which opened yesterday, Monday, at 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT), closed and tallying of the votes began immediately. Syrian Deputy Interior Minister Ahmad Hilal told Agence France Presse that the results may be available most likely tomorrow, Wednesday.

Hilal expressed his satisfaction for having the nearly 6.6 total voters exercise their rights to vote, without specifying the turnout rate in the two days of the elections.

The Interior Ministry had reported that more than 46% of voters who obtained their election cards participated in the legislative elections yesterday, Monday.
 
On the other hand, Hilal affirmed that some voters were abroad or did not obtain their election cards, pointing to the occurrence of rare violations such as, for example, the desire of some voters to vote by using their identity cards.

7364 candidates are seeking to win the People's Congress seats numbered at 250 seats in 15 Syrian governances. 127 seats are allocated for farmers and laborers while the other 123 seats are allocated for other classes of people in accordance with a presidential decree.

The Progressive National Front, which is the ruling coalition consisting of seven parties led by Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, won the last six elections which have taken place since the ascent of Al-Assad to power 28 years ago. It is very likely that it will win the elections for the seventh time.
 
The last general elections in August 1994 witnessed the triumph of 167 National Front candidates and 83 Independents, most of whom are affluent businessmen who presented non-detailed programs.

Since the start of the elections yesterday, Monday, representatives of independent candidates tried to lure voters at the entrances of the polling offices and give them lists carrying the name of their candidate.

Thousands of banners and pictures of the candidates covered nearly all streets.

Independent candidates called for instituting economic reforms to develop the economy and improve social conditions.

The government newspaper "Tishrin" regarded that "the issue of laws, their modernization and development is considered one of the first tasks" of the congress in its upcoming legislative session.

It asserted that "within this framework, we draw your attention (People's Congress members) to Legislation 24 dealing with foreign currency circulation, which is no longer applicable and it has become one of the most significant obstacles to economic and investment activities.
 
Well-known businessman, Representative Badi Flaha, whose term is expiring, thought that reforms are essential to develop the economy "but in Syria we prefer" to implement them slowly but assuredly.

Flaha, who is Deputy Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Damascus, added that since voting for Legislation Number 10 in 1991 to encourage foreign investments, about two thousand projects valued at 600 million dollars were launched, and he affirmed that Legislation Number 24 will be abolished.
