Damascus 11-28 (AFP) - About 6.6 million Syrians head to the polls the day after tomorrow, Monday, to renew the two hundred and fifty seats in the People's Congress, which are being contested by more than seven thousand candidates.

The Progressive National Front (a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party) presented a list of 167 names. It has won the six legislative elections held since the ascent of President Hafez Al-Assad to power in November 1970.

83 seats remain open to independent candidates, businessmen, prominent merchants, lawyers and engineers.  The total number of candidates is 7364 candidates.

A presidential decree allocated 127 seats for laborers and farmers, and 123 seats to other classes of people in 15 Syrian governances.

The election campaign has been on-going in Damascus in a festive atmosphere for about a month. Candidates are receiving citizens every evening at their homes or in tents specially erected for the occasion, and they serve them coffee and desserts amidst songs and Al-Dabka rings. Tens of supporters and friends gather around the affluent candidate Adnan Dakhakhni's table every evening to have dinner and smoke the hubble-bubble.
 
In 1994, merchants prevailed with the entire thirteen seats allocated to "independents" in the Governance (I repeat..) Governance of Damascus which elects 29 representatives.

Writer Samir Abdo expressed regret because there are "a few intellectuals, artists and writers" among the contestants, as compared to the last elections, and because they do not have "a great chance for success due to the high cost" of the election campaign. Newspapers said that every independent candidate spent between 200 thousand and 500 thousand dollars on his election campaign.
  
Candidate Arif Dalilah, the economic expert and former Dean of the College of Economy at Damascus University, decided finally to hang several banners in the streets after he had ruled that out. He calls for "legislative, economic and administrative reforms," regarding it as "an urgent task" before the People's Congress.
  
Poet Maha Kanwat, the Progressive National Front's candidate, promised in an interview published by +Tishreen+ Newspaper that she "will work in the event of her win to modernize the laws dealing with women, family and youths."
 
A statement from the ruling Baath Party, published last Wednesday, said that "voting is a right for and duty by every citizen in order to deepen diversity and foster democracy," and that the national leadership of the party "made available all guarantees for free and unbiased elections on the basis of equality and fairness."
 
The Ministry of Interior's numbers show that 8498 polling centers will open at schools, factories and public administrations all over the country.
 
The election will be based on lists and on the majority system in a single round.
 
The Syrian constitution states that the People's Congress discusses government policy, legislates laws, grants pardons, sets the budget, ratifies international treaties and agreements, and may withhold confidence from the entire government or from any of its members.
