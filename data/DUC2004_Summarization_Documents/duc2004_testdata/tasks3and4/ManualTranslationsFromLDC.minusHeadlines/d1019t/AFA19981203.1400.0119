Damascus 12-3 (AFP) - The ruling coalition in Syria, the Progressive National Front, achieved a crushing, albeit expected, win in the legislative elections that took place on Monday and Tuesday.

The Front, which is comprised of seven political parties led by the Socialist Arab Baath Party, had won in the last six legislative elections that were held since President Hafez Al-Assad assumed the presidency of the country 28 years ago.
  
According to the results announced by Interior Minister Mohammad Harba in a press conference he held in Damascus, all members of the Progressive National Front, numbered at 167 members, were elected without exception. 

The other remaining seats in the People's Congress, or 83 seats out of 250, were won by candidates described as "independents." "Laborers and farmers" won 127 seats and "the other classes of people" 123 seats in accordance with the presidential decree.

Harba announced the names of the 250 representatives who will form the new People's Congress, which will include 26 women versus 24 in the year 1994.

175 members will join the congress for the first time for a four-year term; 76 former representatives, including the congress' Speaker, Abdel Kader Kaddoura, were re-elected.

In Damascus, nine industrialists and affluent merchants were elected versus ten in the previous congress.

The Syrian minister added that the turnout rate reached 82% out of 6.6 million voters who obtained their election cards versus 50.33% in the year 1994.

Basil Dahdouh, the only candidate from the Socialist Nationalist Syrian Party, a non-member in the Progressive Front, was re-elected. It should be noted that the party is not licensed, but the authorities overlook its activities.
  
Dahdouh announced to Agence France Presse that he will continue to "represent the political and social thinking which I represent in Syria (...) in cooperation and coordination with all present parties, especially the Baath." He indicated that his party works for "establishing social justice and the nationalist rights for Syria."
 
The Progressive Front, which was established on 7 March 1972, encompasses in addition to the Baath Party, the Syrian Communist Party's two wings led by Wisal Bikdash and Yousef Faisal, consecutively; the Arab Socialist Party (Safwan Kodsi); the Socialist Unionist Movement (Faisal Ismael); the Arab Socialists (Abdel Ghani Kanwat); and the Democratic Socialist Unionist Party (Nasserite led by Ahmad Al-Assad).
     
The Syrian Interior Minister indicated that the elections were cancelled in Deir Al-Zour (420 km northeast of Damascus) because of the incidence of violations at the polling offices, but they were resumed the following day.

The minister said that 31 representatives are under 35 years in age and 13 representatives are over 50 years in age. 37 representatives hold college degrees.
    
One of the elected representatives ruled out the occurrence of "significant changes in internal or external policies" implemented by Syria, considering that it is "possible" to form a new Syrian government.
