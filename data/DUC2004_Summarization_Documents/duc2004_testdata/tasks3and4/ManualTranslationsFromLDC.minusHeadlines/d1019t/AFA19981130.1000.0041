Damascus 11-30 (AFP) - Syrian voters began heading to the polling offices this morning, Monday, to elect a new People's Congress (Parliament), in which the ruling coalition is expected to win a majority of its seats.

7364 candidates are entering the elections to win the People's Congress seats numbered at 250 seats in 15 Syrian governances. 127 seats are allocated for farmers and laborers while the other 123 seats are allocated for other classes of people in accordance with a presidential decree.

Nearly 6.6 million Syrian voters obtained their election cards to participate in these elections, which are the seventh to be held since the ascent of President Hafez Al-Assad to power in 1970.

The Progressive National Front (a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party) presented a list of 167 names. 83 seats are left for independent candidates.

The front had won 167 seats, including 135 seats for the Baath Party, in the last elections in 1994. 

Syrian Interior Minister Mohammad Harba said in a statement reported by the "SANA" News Agency that "the great interest in nomination for the People's Congress membership and the wide activity that accompanied it by the candidates, whether they were from the Progressive National Front or from the independent candidates, expressed the full maturity of the cause of democracy in our country."
    
He added that "with this deep understanding and with this genuine political and patriotic awareness, we view competition between candidates not for the purpose of securing a position or obtaining whatever benefit but for the purpose of winning the honor of representing the people and serving the country."

The government newspaper "Tishrin" said in a commentary that "what is required from the new People's Congress is no less important than what was required from the previous congresses, and it may even exceed it in importance in view of the serious challenges facing the region in general and Syria in particular."

It added, "Because Syria speaks out with this solid patriotic stance, she is subject to conspiracy, and we have recently observed one side of the enemies attempts to instigate problems with Syria and remove her from the real confrontation with Israel."

In interviews published by the press, voters had demanded "reforms" to develop the economy and improve the standard of living for the Syrian people.

The election will be based on lists and on the majority system in a single round.

In the event that the turnout rate in the polling offices did not reach 51%, voting will be extended till 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT) tomorrow, Tuesday.
