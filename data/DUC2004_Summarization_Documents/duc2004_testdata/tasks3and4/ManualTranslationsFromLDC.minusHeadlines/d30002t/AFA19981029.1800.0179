Tocoa (Honduras) 10-29 (AFP) - Various sources announced today, Thursday, that at least 25 villages or towns on the Caribbean Coast in Honduras disappeared under the waters of the Iguana river, whose level had risen significantly due to the heavy rains cause by Hurricane "Mitch". No word yet on the fate of the residents whose number is estimated to be in the thousands.

Along 20 km, where the Iguana river and its streams stretch between the city of Tocoa and the sea near Port Trujillo, all villages and provinces disappeared under between 10 to 15 meters of water, as reported by an Agence France Presse photographer in the region. 

Engineer Oswaldo Capallero from the National Agricultural Corporation said that "the river waters mixed with seawater, and all of the region became a swamp of water with waves' height reaching about two meters."
