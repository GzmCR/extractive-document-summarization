Abu Dhabi 12-6 (AFP) - A United Nations spokeswoman told Agence France Presse that the Secretary-General of the international organization, Kofi Anan, informed the American Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, by telephone today, Sunday, that "he is on his way to resolving the problem" related to the Lockerbie attack case.
   
Nadia Younis, the spokeswoman accompanying Kofi Anan, who is currently visiting the Emirates, said that Anan informed Albright in a telephone call today, Sunday, from the plane that was carrying him from Tunisia to Abu Dhabi, "We are on our way to resolving the problem" with Libya that arose from the Lockerbie attack.
 
She added that the Secretary-General informed Albright that "he held fruitful and positive talks with the Libyan leader" Moammar Al Kaddafy regarding the Lockerbie attack case.

She went on to say that Anan informed Albright, "The Libyans have their own way in consulting with their own people (...) in order to make a decision and announce it."

Younis explained that Anan informed Albright that "he is awaiting for the Popular Committees to discuss this matter next week."

The American Department of State had expressed yesterday evening, Wednesday, "its frustration" following the meeting between Anan and the Libyan leader,  voicing its regret for not achieving any progress in addressing the Lockerbie case.
 
The Department of State's deputy spokesman, James Foley, said, "We feel frustrated because Libya did not yet commit" to United Nations resolutions demanding that Libya hand over two Libyan citizens suspected in involvement in blowing up an American Pan Am airliner over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland in December 1988.

Anan left Tunisia today, Sunday, after embarking on a mission in Libya during which he held talks aiming at reaching agreement calling for Libya to hand over the two Libyans suspected in involvement in blowing up the plane.
