Tripoli 12-12 (AFP) - Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy received today, Saturday, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jabr Al Thani.

The Libyan News Agency reported that the Qatari minister delivered to Al Kaddafy a letter from the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, on bilateral relations "reiterating his country's support for Libya in the Lockerbie case.

The Gulf Cooperation Council, in which Qatar is a member, expressed at the end of its annual summit Wednesday in Abu Dhabi its hope to reach a resolution to the Lockerbie case following United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan's visit to Libya.
 
Anan had visited Libya last Saturday to convince her to hand over to Holland the two Libyan suspects, Abdel Bassit Al Muqrahi and Al Amin Khalifa, for trial there in exchange for suspending the sanctions imposed against Libya since 1992.

The attack on a Pan Am plane that exploded over Lockerbie (Scotland) resulted in killing 270 people in 1988.
