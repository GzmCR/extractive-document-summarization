Tunis 10-19 (AFP) - The Tunisian Foreign Ministry announced that Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy arrived in Tunis this morning, Monday, for a "brotherly and recreational" visit, at the invitation of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Bin Ali.
   
The ministry added that Al Kadaffy arrived at the border point of Ras Jdair by land due to the aerial embargo imposed on Libya since the year 1992.
 
Libya, which is being accused by the International Security Council of supporting terrorism, has been subjected to an aerial and military embargo since April 1992 that was aggravated by the freezing of Libyan assets abroad in 1993, in addition to imposing restrictions on purchasing oil products. 

The Security Council passed a resolution last August 28 suspending the embargo against Libya in return for handing over the two suspects in involvement in the blowing up of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie in 1988 for trial before a Scottish court in The Netherlands.

Nevertheless, Libya and the Western nations are still divided over ways to conduct this trial.
 
Tripoli agreed in principle to hand over the two suspects, but demands security guarantees for handing them over.
