Washington 12-21 (AFP) - American President Bill Clinton announced today, Monday, that the United States will not negotiate with Libya on conditions to hand over to justice the two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie attack and will demand imposing stiffer sanctions against Libya if they were not handed over by next February.
 
Clinton said while attending this afternoon, Monday, a ceremony held at Arlington National Cemetery in memory of 270 victims lost in the attack on an American Pan Am plane over Lockerbie ten years ago, "Unless they are handed over by the time the sanctions are reviewed (in February), we will demand tougher sanctions against Libya."

He added, "I want to be abundantly clear. Our policy does not depend on putting trust in Al Kaddafy's statements, but rather on testing them. We presented a proposal on the basis of take-it-or-leave-it, and there is no room for negotiation on that."
 
Clinton indicated that in the event the suspects were handed over and convicted, they must "do their time in Scotland."
 
Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy had declared that Libya will not hand over the suspects except to an international court.

He said that "the solution is an international court to be setup with judges from America, Libya, England and other countries."
