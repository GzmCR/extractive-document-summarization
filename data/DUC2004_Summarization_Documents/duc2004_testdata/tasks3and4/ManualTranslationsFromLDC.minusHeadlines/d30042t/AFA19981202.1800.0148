Tripoli 12-2 (AFP) - Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy said that the International Security Council has no right to interfere in the Lockerbie case, which has to do, according to him, with the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.
  
Al Kaddafy said in a statement published today, Wednesday, in Tripoli, "The International Security Council does not have the right to handle the Lockerbie matter after the decision issued by the International Court of Justice, the legal arm of the United Nations, which ruled that it has no jurisdiction in this case."
  
The United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Anan, announced today, Wednesday, in the capital Algiers that he intends to go to Libya to discuss handing over to Holland for trial two Libyans accused of involvement in the blowing up of an American passenger plane over the Scottish town of Lockerbie (270 dead in 1988). 
 
Anan said, "It is likely that I will pay a short visit" to Libya. Anan left the Algerian capital this afternoon heading to Tunisia after he paid a visit to Algeria aiming at moving the peace process in the Western Sahara.
