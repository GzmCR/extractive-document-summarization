Baghdad 11-11 (AFP) - The Special Representative of United Nations Secretary-General in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, announced today, Wednesday, after meeting with the Iraqi Deputy  Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, that Iraq refuses to back down from its decision to cut off cooperation with the international disarmament inspectors.
 
Shah said after a meeting with Tariq Aziz, "I met with Aziz during the past three or four days and I stressed that Iraq must commit to the Security Council's resolutions in order to start a comprehensive review" of the sanctions.

He added that "his answer (today) was the answer he had given me earlier, which is that they are not ready to back down from their decision unless the Security Council did something about the sanctions."
 
Iraq had stopped last October 31 its cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission in charge of disarming the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM) after it had curbed its activities since the fifth of last August.
 
Iraq is demanding as a condition for backing down from its decision that the Security Council discuss lifting the sanctions imposed upon it since the year 1990.

On the other hand, the Security Council demanded that Iraq resume its cooperation with the Special Commission as a condition for conducting any review of the sanctions.

Prakash Shah indicated that he informed Aziz of the United Nations decision to withdraw all of its non-essential staff "as a precaution for possible military strikes against Iraq."

He added that "key staff will remain here and United Nations programs will continue."
