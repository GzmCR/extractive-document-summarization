New York (United Nations) 11-1 (AFP) - An official of the International Special Commission in charge of disarming Iraqi weapons (UNSCOM) announced yesterday, Saturday, that the Commission will keep its inspectors in Iraq despite Baghdad's decision to stop its cooperation with them.

The Commission's Deputy Chairman, Charles Duelfer, said, "We will keep the inspectors there in the hope that Iraq may back down from its decision."
 
Baghdad had announced that it will stop its cooperation with UNSCOM completely but indicated that it will not ask for their departure.

Yet, the Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoun, announced on Saturday that the United Nations' inspectors must be deported from Iraq "because they no longer have business" there.

UNSCOM employs about 120 persons in Iraq, including 40 inspectors.
