Amman 10-13 (AFP) - The Jordanian Ambassador to Washington, Marwan Al Muasher, said that the Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, finished the fourth out of six phases of chemotherapy prescribed for him by the doctors at the American Mayo Clinic Hospital, where he was admitted three months before in the aftermath of inflicting lymphatic node cancer.
 
Al Muasher explained in a telephone statement reported today, Tuesday, by Al Dastoor newspaper that King Hussein "is now spending a recovery period between the fourth and fifth phases" in the United States.

The Jordanian monarch had begun the fourth phase on the fifth of this month. He has two phases ahead of him, each is four days in duration and separated between one another by three weeks, according to the schedule put together by the Mayo Clinic's doctors.

The Jordanian Ambassador expected the return of King Hussein to his country "in the last week of next month after he finishes the sixth phase."
