Amman 11-8 (AFP) - Jordanian Information Minister, Nasser Joudah, reported today, Sunday, that the Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, reacted in "a very positive way" to the treatment he has been undergoing since last July 14 to fight his infliction with lymphatic node cancer.

Joudah explained to reporters, "King Hussein reacted in a very positive way to treatment, and the latest test results exceeded what was expected."

The Jordanian Ambassador to Washington, Marwan Al-Muasher, said in turn that "the latest medical tests underdone by King Hussein showed the absence of any trace of cancerous cells."
  
Al-Muasher explained to the "Al-Dastoor" newspaper that the Jordanian monarch will undergo a sixth and final phase of chemotherapy, as a precaution only.
 
The Jordanian monarch (63 years of age) finished the fifth phase of chemotherapy a short while ago at the Mayo Hospital in Rochester (Minnesota).
