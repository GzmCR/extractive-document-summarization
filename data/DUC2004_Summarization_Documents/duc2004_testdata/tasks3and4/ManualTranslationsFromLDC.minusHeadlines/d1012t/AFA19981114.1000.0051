Amman 11-14 (AFP) - The Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, confirmed on the occasion of his 63rd birthday that he completely got rid of the lymphatic node cancer and that he will be able to return home soon.
 
The Jordanian monarch, who is present in the United States where he is receiving treatment, said in a telephone call with Jordanian state television last evening, Friday, "As far as chemotherapy is concerned, the last phase was finished during the past 10 days, and there is no trace of the disease itself."

On the occasion of the king's sixty-third birthday, which falls today, Saturday, the Jordanian television unusually continued to air its programs throughout the night and commissioned transmission via satellite to the United States where King Hussein has been present since last July 14.
 
The Jordanian monarch said, addressing his people, "God willing, I will be with you and among you soon, once again."

He explained that the doctors, who are treating him at the Mayo specialist hospital in Rochester (Minnesota), "are preparing my bone marrow for implant in the coming days, God willing, so that whatever traces that may have been left of the disease can be eliminated."
 
The Mayo Hospital issued a statement published today by the "Jordan Times" Newspaper confirming that the Jordanian monarch was completely cured of the lymphatic node cancer, adding that doctors will perform the implant in the sixth and final phase of his chemotherapy by the end of this November.

The paper quoted Information Minister Nasser Joudah as saying that the Jordanian monarch will return to Amman during the last ten days of next December.
