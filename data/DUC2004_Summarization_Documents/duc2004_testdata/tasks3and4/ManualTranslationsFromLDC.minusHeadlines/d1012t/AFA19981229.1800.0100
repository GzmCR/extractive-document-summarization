Amman 12-29 (AFP) - Jordan's Crown Prince, Prince Hassan Bin Talal, announced today, Tuesday, that the Jordanian monarch was completely cured and left the Mayo Clinic Hospital in the United States, following the completion of all phases of treatment against the cancer disease.
 
In an address to the Jordanian people broadcast by state television, Prince Hassan, King Hussein's younger brother, said, "While you are listening to these words, Al Hussein would have left the hospital (...), healed and cured of the disease. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic Hospital have allowed him to leave following the completion of treatment that was crowned with total success."

Prince Hassan told Jordanians, "I rush to you the good news (...) of the healing and curing" of King Hussein, and that he left the Mayo Clinic "aboard his plane beginning his return trip", indicating that "several days of convalescence will pass before he arrives in Jordan."

Jordanian television reported later that King Hussein's plane landed at Andrews Air Base near Washington, where he arrived on a visit that will last several days.

The Jordanian monarch (63 years of age) was admitted to the Mayo Clinic Hospital in the American state of Minnesota last July 14, following his infliction of lymphatic node cancer.

Following six rounds of chemotherapy, King Hussein's doctors announced last month that he was completely cured of the disease. He was subjected after that to re-implanting of the bone marrow as a precautionary measure.

Prince Hassan disclosed the content of a letter he had received from the Jordanian monarch in which the latter affirms that "the doctors at the Mayo Clinic and their colleagues in the United States are relieved by the test results, which conclude our stay here until a later date in the third month of next year, God willing. He also affirmed that "all tests" that were conducted after "the treatment voyage" were all matched their best expectations."

He explained that his flight movement will be "to Washington to spend a few days, then to London then Amman, God willing," indicating that the reason for taking some time off on the way is for recovery as the start of regaining vigor and energy to their normal levels."
