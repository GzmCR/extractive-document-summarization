Amman 10-30 (AFP) - The Jordanian News Agency "Petra" reported today, Friday, that the Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, who is inflicted with lymphatic node cancer, affirmed that the fifth phase of chemotherapy is proceeding successfully.

The Jordanian Crown Prince, Prince Hassan Bin Talal, made a telephone call to the Jordanian monarch, who has been undergoing treatment in the United States since July, and informed him that the treatment is proceeding "assuredly and confidently", after King Hussein responded to the fourth phase of treatment better than it was expected.

The "Mayo Clinic" Hospital in Rochester (Minnesota) announced yesterday, Wednesday, that King Hussein's treatment is nearing its end, and it will be finished within three or four weeks with the sixth and last session of chemotherapy.

The Jordanian monarch (62 years of age) had participated in Washington last week in the signing of the transitional Wye Plantation Accord between the Israelis and Palestinians.
