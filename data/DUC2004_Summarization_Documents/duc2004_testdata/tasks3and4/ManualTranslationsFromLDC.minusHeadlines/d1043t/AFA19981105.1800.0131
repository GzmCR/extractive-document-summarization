Washington 11-5 (AFP) - The American Defense Secretary, William Cohen, expressed his confidence that the Gulf Arab countries will give support for taking "an appropriate action" against Iraq, the American Defense Department (The Pentagon) announced following Cohen's visit to the region's countries.
  
However, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, did not offer any clarifications on the promises obtained by Cohen during his tour, which took him to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
 
Bacon said that the secretary "noted that the Gulf Arab countries were unanimous in condemning Iraq for its refusal to cooperate with international Special Commission inspectors of Iraqi weapons."
