Abu Dhabi 11-5 (AFP) - The Emirates News Agency announced that the American Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, arrived today, Thursday, in Abu Dhabi, which is the last stop of a Gulf tour he is taking to discuss the Iraqi crisis.
 
The Agency said that the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, received Cohen upon his arrival.

Cohen arrived from the Sultanate of Oman, which he visited for a few hours during which time he met with Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, who called on Iraq to respect the United Nations resolutions.

Cohen visited so far Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain as part of a tour to hold consultations on the crisis stemming from Iraq's decision to stop cooperation with United Nations disarmament inspectors.

Diplomats in the Gulf said that Cohen heard throughout every leg of his Gulf tour that the region's countries reject the use of force and support a diplomatic solution to push Iraq to back down from its decision and resume the process of disarmament.

Today, the Emirati Al-Ittihad Newspaper affirmed, in a commentary entitled "The Diplomatic Solution is the Arab Option", that "Arabs refuse to have their territories become a launching pad for any military operation against Iraq," stressing "the importance that the International Security Council hear the Iraqi positions."
