Amman 11-5 (AFP) - It was learned from an official source that American Defense Secretary William Cohen held talks in Amman today, Thursday, with Jordan's Crown Prince, Prince Al-Hassan Bin Talal, shortly after Cohen's arrival in the Jordanian capital as part of his tour in the region.
  
Joining the talks were Prime Minister Fayez AL-Tarawneh, Chief of the Royal Court Jawad Al-Anani, Foreign Minister Abd Al-Elah Al-Khatib, and Minister of Information Nasser Joudah, according to what the same source explained.

The source added that crisis that broke out between Iraq and the United Nations was at the core of Cohen's talks with Jordan's Crown Prince, who represents King Hussein in running the country's affairs.

It should be noted that Jordan called on both Iraq and the United Nations to settle the crisis by peaceful means. King Hussein, who is receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma in the United States, expressed "his concern for the possibility of subjecting Iraq to a military strike."

Prior to Amman, Cohen visited Riyadh, Kuwait, Doha, Manama, Muscat and Abu Dhabi. According to diplomatic sources, these capitals expressed their opposition to striking Iraq militarily.
 
The American Secretary also visited Sharm El-Sheikh where he held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
 
In Washington, American President Bill Clinton described Cohen's tour as "good" and warned Iraq about the possibility of an international response affirming that the United States "has the support she needs."

Washington did not rule out resorting to force against Iraq in response to its decision on Saturday to cut off its cooperation with the United Nations Commission in charge of disarming Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM).
 
The Security Council approved a draft resolution yesterday calling on Iraq to resume its cooperation immediately with the Special Commission's inspectors, but the resolution does not threaten the use of force.
  
The American secretary is due to leave Amman tomorrow, Friday, and heads to Ankara.
