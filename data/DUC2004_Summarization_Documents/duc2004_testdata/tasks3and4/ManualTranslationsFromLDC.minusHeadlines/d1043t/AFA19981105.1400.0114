Washington 11-5 (AFP) - American President Bill Clinton warned Iraq about the possibility of an international response, affirming that the United States "has the support she needs."

Responding to a question about the nature of international support for measures that may be taken against Baghdad, Clinton said, "We believe we have the support we need, and all options are open."

Clinton added that the American Defense Secretary, William Cohen, is currently conducting "a good tour" in the Gulf Arab states. Cohen arrived today, Thursday, in the State of the United Arab Emirates, his last stop of a tour in the Gulf focusing on the Iraqi crisis. He had earlier visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.

According to diplomats in the Gulf, Cohen was met with opposition from these countries to any military strike against Iraq.

The British Ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, announced last evening, Wednesday, that the Security Council approved a draft resolution calling on Iraq to immediately resume its cooperation with United Nations Special Commission's inspectors for disarmament (UNSCOM).

The international resolution, which may be issued today, Thursday, condemns Iraq's Saturday declaration of the full cessation of its cooperation with UNSCOM, in what was considered "a flagrant violation" of United Nations resolutions. However, the resolution does not threaten the use of force.
 
Iraq begins today, Thursday, a campaign to mobilize the population for the possibility of being subjected to an American strike following the cessation of its cooperation with United Nations inspectors and the expectation of failure for the United States efforts to rally the support of the Gulf countries for a military offensive.
