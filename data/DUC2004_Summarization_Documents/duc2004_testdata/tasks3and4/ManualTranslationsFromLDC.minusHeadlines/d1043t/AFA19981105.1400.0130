Sharm El-Sheikh 11-5 (AFP) - An official source reported that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak received this evening, Thursday, the American Defense Secretary William Cohen, shortly after his arrival in Sharm El-Sheikh in the Sinai Desert.

The source added that Egyptian Defense Minister General Hussein Tantawi and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa attended the interview, which lasted 45 minutes.
 
The American envoy, who was due to go to Jordan and Turkey, left Egypt after the interview, without making any statements.

Cohen is continuing a tour with Washington's Allies on the Iraqi crisis. He ended the seventh visit to a Gulf Arab state; he had earlier visited the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. A diplomatic source reported that countries of the region informed Cohen that they reject resorting to force and support the diplomatic solution to make Iraq resume the process of disarmament.

The Egyptian press today denounced the "aggressiveness" of the American Administration toward Iraq the day after Amr Moussa's demand for the intervention of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan personally to resolve the Iraqi crisis.

The American president described the Cohen tour as "a good tour," affirming that the United States "got the support we needed."

Washington did not rule out resorting to force against Iraq for cutting off on Saturday its cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission in charge of  disarming Iraq's weapons (UNSCOM).

The International Security Council ratified a resolution today calling on Iraq to resume its cooperation with UNSCOM immediately.
