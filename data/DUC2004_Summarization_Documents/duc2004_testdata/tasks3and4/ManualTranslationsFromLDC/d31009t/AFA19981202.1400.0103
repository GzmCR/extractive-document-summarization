Bulent Ecevit Designated to Form New Government in Turkey
 
Ankara 12-2 (AFP) - The leader of the Democratic Left Party, Bulent Ecevit, announced today, Wednesday, that Turkish President Suleiman Demirel has designated him to form the government in Turkey.
  
In a press release following a meeting with President Demirel, Ecevit said, "I was designated to form the new government, and I will try to form it as soon as possible and in a way that will gain the Parliament's confidence."
 
He added, "The new government will not only be an election government," in a reference to the approach of the early legislative elections due to be held next April.
 
He continued, "There are several problems facing Turkey internally and abroad", in a reference to the case of the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, Abdullah Ocalan, whom Italy refuses to hand over to Turkey.
 
Ecevit explained that he would start from tomorrow, Thursday, his consultations with the other political leaders.

Analysts think that he might head a government that includes "the adversarial brothers" of the right, or Mesut Yilmaz, the leader of the Motherland Party, and Tanso Ciller, the leader of the True Path Party.

His government will be the fifty-sixth government during the 75-year history of the Republic of Turkey.

Ecevit succeeds Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted by the Parliament on November 25 because he was accused of establishing "ties with the Mafia."

Bulent Ecevit (73 years of age) was a Deputy Prime Minister in the former government and a member in the government coalition headed by Yilmaz.

He had taken over the premiership in 1973 and then from 1978 to 1979. He is the one who ordered the army to intervene in Cyprus in 1974 following the military coup that was staged by the nationalistic Greek Cypriots for the purpose of annexing the island to Greece.

He was at the time presiding over a coalition with the Islamic "National Rescue" Party under the leadership of Necmettin Erbakan, a coalition that lasted ten months.
