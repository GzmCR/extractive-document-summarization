Turkish Prime Minister-Designate Gains Support of Two Parties

Ankara 12-28 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister-Designate, Yalim Eriz, gained today, Monday, the support of two political parties in his attempts to form a new government, a month after the collapse of Mesut Yilmaz's government in the aftermath of accusations against him about establishing "ties with the Mafia."

Yilmaz, who heads the Motherland party, and the leader of the Democratic Left (leftist nationalistic) Bulent Ecevit, promised to offer their support to Eriz "to facilitate the formation of a government."

In turn, the Chairman of the Islamic Virtue Party, Recai Kutan, did not declare his position and indicated that his party will take a stand at the conclusion of a second round of talks due to be held by Eriz with the heads of the political parties next week.
  
Eriz said today, Monday, in a statement to the press, "I am confident of my ability to form a government and that this government will gain confidence in the Parliament with the highest possible number of votes."

Turkish President Suleiman Demirel had designated Yalim Eriz (54 years of age) last Wednesday to form the government to succeed Yilmaz's government, which was ousted by the Parliament on the twenty fifth of last November in the aftermath of accusing it of "establishing ties with the Mafia."

Eriz will meet on Tuesday with the leader of the Republican People's Party (socialist democratic), Deniz Baykal, and with the leader of the True Path Party, Tansu Ciller.
