Memorandum for Withholding Confidence from Mesut Yilmaz's Government Due to "Ties with the Mafia"
 
Ankara 11-11 (AFP) - A Turkish opposition party submitted a memorandum today, Wednesday, for withholding confidence from Mesut Yilmaz's government because of "misusing power and establishing secret ties with the Mafia."

The "True Path" Party under the leadership of the former Foreign Minister, Tansu Ciller, submitted the memorandum following the airing of a recorded tape containing information disclosed by businessman Korkmaz Yigit yesterday evening, Tuesday, via two television channels he owns.

In the tape, Yigit detailed his relationships with a Turkish Mafia boss jailed in France named Alaattin Cakici. Yigit says that the Prime Minister and Minister of State for the Economy, Gunes Taner, knew about this relationship when he bought the state-owned Turkish Commercial Bank last July for 600 million dollars.
