Ecevit Proposes Formation of Minority Government
 
Ankara 12-9 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister-Designate, Bulent Ecevit, proposed today, Wednesday, the formation of a minority government that will only includes his party, the Democratic Left Party, after Tansu Ciller refused to participate in a trilateral government coalition that includes her opponent Mesut Yilmaz.
 
Ecevit announced in a press conference at the conclusion of a meeting with Ciller that "Ciller said that her party may support this ideas and that she will hold consultations with it."

Ecevit proposed that the Democratic Left Party (61 representatives out of the 550 in the Parliament) form a minority government supported on the outside by the other parties represented in the Parliament, including the True Path Party led by Ciller and the Motherland Party led by Yilmaz.

Yesterday, Tuesday, Ciller refused to participate in the trilateral government proposed by Ecevit and called for the formation of an expanded government coalition where all parties represented in the Parliament can participate. Nevertheless, that means the participation of the Islamic "Virtue" Party led by Recai Kutan in the government, something that the army, which considers itself the protector of secularism, is opposed to.

The Parliament had ousted last November 25 Yilmaz's coalition with Ecevit as its deputy, through its adoption of confidence-withholding memoranda that were submitted by the opposition, including the True Path Party, for "establishing secret ties with the Mafia."
