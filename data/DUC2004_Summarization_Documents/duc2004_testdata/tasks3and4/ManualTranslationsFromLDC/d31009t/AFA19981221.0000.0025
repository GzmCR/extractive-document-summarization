Ecevit Announces Giving Up Formation of Turkish Government

Ankara 12-21 (AFP) - Turkish Prime Minister-Designate Bulent Ecevit officially announced today, Monday, giving up the task of forming the government after his efforts in that regard have failed.

Ecevit said at the conclusion of a brief meeting with President Suleiman Demirel, "I have given up the task of forming the new government that the president designated to me."
 
Demirel had designated Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party (nationalistic leftist), to form the new government on the second of December after the Parliament ousted the government of Mesut Yilmaz on 25 November due to "his ties with the Mafia."
