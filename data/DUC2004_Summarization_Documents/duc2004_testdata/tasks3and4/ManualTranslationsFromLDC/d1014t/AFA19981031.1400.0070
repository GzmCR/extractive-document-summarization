Presidential Elections in Algeria in April

Algiers 10-31 (AFP) - It was learned today, Saturday, from the opposing Assembly for Culture and Democracy that the early presidential elections announced by Algerian President Liamine Zeroual last September will be held next April.

Zeroual announced in a letter he addressed to the Algerian political parties today, Saturday, that these elections "will be held in April" without setting the exact date, however.

Zeroual is due to address the Algerians this evening, Saturday, in a televised speech on the occasion of the Algerian Revolution on the first of November 1954, which led to Algeria's independence on the fifth of July 1962.

The Algerian president surprised everyone when he announced on September 11 that he will abbreviate his term. He said that he will not be nominated again for the presidential elections, which he had announced will be held by the end of next February.

Two weeks later and on the urging of the parties, Liamine Zeroual announced that he is ready to postpone the presidential election's date "for a few weeks."

Zeroual was elected in November 1995 for a five-year term with more than 60% vote majority in the first presidential elections in which the political parties in Algeria participated.
