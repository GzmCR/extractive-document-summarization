Zeroual Receives Unrepresented Parties in Parliament within Framework of Early Presidential Elections

Algiers 10-7 (AFP) - Algerian Radio reported that Algerian President Liamine Zeroual received today, Wednesday, the parties that are not represented in the Parliament in preparation for the early presidential elections that are expected to be held by the end of February 1999. 

The Republican National Coalition, led by former Prime Minister Redha Malik, and the Algerian Renewal Party boycotted this meeting. The leader of the Renewal Party, Nour El-din Bukrouh, was one of Zeroual's opponents in the presidential elections in the year 1995.

Zeroual had received last September 30 the parties represented in the Parliament and agreed to delay the "early presidential elections "for a few weeks" if a "concord" is forged between all political partners.
 
However, President Zeroual refused to respond positively to the request of some parties to complete his term and affirmed that he will not back down from his "political" decision to abbreviate his term.

Zeroual proposed February 25 as elections date, but this date will not become final until after the agreement between all of the political partners, according to what was reported by the First Secretary of the Socialist Forces Front, Ahmed Djeddai.
