Resignation of Bushtein, Algerian President's Advisor and Closest Aid 
 
Algeria 10-19 (AFP) - An official source announced that Mohammad Bushtein, the  advisor to the Algerian administration and President Liamine Zeroual's confidant, submitted his resignation from his post today, Monday. 

The resignation comes 24 hours after the resignation of the Justice Minister, Mohammad Adami, which was accepted by President Zeroual on Sunday.

Observers consider Bushtein as the regime's strongman. He was subjected with Adami recently to a campaign via the press that denounced their political practices.
 
These two resignations come at a time when Algeria is getting ready to hold presidential elections by February 1999.
