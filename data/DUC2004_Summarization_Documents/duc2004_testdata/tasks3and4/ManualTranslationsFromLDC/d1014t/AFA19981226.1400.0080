Bouteflika Confirms His Candidacy for Presidential Elections in Algeria

Algiers 12-26 (AFP) - Former Algerian Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Bouteflika (61 years) confirmed today, Saturday, his candidacy for the early presidential elections that will be held next April.

A statement issued by his "Information Office", published by the official Algerian News Agency, said that "Abdul Aziz Bouteflika confirms his candidacy for the early presidential elections in April 1999."
 
The National Liberation Front (formerly the sole party) had on December 16 selected Bouteflika, the former minister in the administration of Hawari Boumedien from 1964 to 1978, to represent it in the elections.

He received the backing of the Islamic Al-Nahdha Party yesterday, Friday. The Advisory Council of the Al-Nahdha Party explained that it selected Bouteflika following the decision of its president, Sheikh Abdullah Jaballah, not to nominate himself.

Last September 11, President Liamine Zeroual announced that he will abbreviate his term that expires in November 2000 and that he will not re-nominate himself for a new five-year term.
  
The National Liberation Front belongs to the government coalition that was headed by Prime Minister Ismael Hamdani, who succeeded Ahmad Ouyahya on December 14.
 
Al-Nahdha has about 9% of the Parliament's seats, and it is the second legal party in Algeria after the Peace Society Movement (formerly Hamas) under the leadership of Sheikh Mahfouz Nahnah, who nominated himself in the elections.

Nahnah had collected 25% of the votes in the first plural presidential elections in Algeria in November 1995.
