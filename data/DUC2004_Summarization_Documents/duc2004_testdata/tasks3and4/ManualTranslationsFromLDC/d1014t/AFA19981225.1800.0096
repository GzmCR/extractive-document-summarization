Algerian "Al-Nahdha" Movement Supports Bouteflika's Nomination for Presidency
 
Algiers 12-25 (AFP) - The "Al-Nahdha" Movement (Islamist) declared in Algiers today, Friday, its support for nominating former Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Bouteflika for the upcoming early presidential elections next April.
  
The Movement's Advisory Council explained that it opted for backing Bouteflika after its president, Abdullah Jaballah, refrained from nominating himself.

The "Al-Nahdha" Movement, which occupies nine seats in the Parliament, is considered the second Islamic party in Algeria after the "Society for Peace" Movement led by Sheikh Mahfouz Nahnah. The National Liberation Front had earlier supported Bouteflika's nomination for the elections.
  
It should be noted that the former Foreign Minister between the years 1964 and 1979 has yet to announce his candidacy for the presidency post.
