San Jose 11-6 (AFP) - Mudslides and floods caused by Hurricane "Mitch" have resulted in killing about 11500 people and missing about 13 thousand in Central America, especially in Honduras and Nicaragua, according to official statistics published the night of Thursday-Friday.

The number of people harmed by the hurricane has surpassed 2.8 million.

The toll rose particularly in Nicaragua with the discovery of 500 bodies in the town of Juaolie, which was practically destroyed, in the northern part of the country, and a hundred more on the flanks of the Casitas Volcano near Posoltega, 140 kilometers northwest of Managua, where a mudslide last Friday erased five villages from existence.
 
President Arnaldo Aleman acknowledged that the number of dead reached or exceeded four thousand.  Government spokesman, Gilberto Wing, said that bodies are being found in areas that are still isolated, and there is a large number of missing people.

According to civil and military sources, floods from the Rio Coco River destroyed 20 towns near Juaolie.

Various sources reported that there are 730 thousand to a million people who were harmed by the hurricane.

In Honduras, the death toll remained at seven thousand yesterday, Thursday.  President Carlos Flores estimated the number of missing by 11 thousand instead of 12 thousand yesterday.

There are one million and 800 thousand people, or more than one third of the population, who are without shelter or were directly harmed.

In Guatemala, President Alvaro Arzo said that the number of dead rose from 194 to 197 since yesterday, and the number of people devastated rose from 60 thousand to 78800 thousand.
 
Throughout Central America, but particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua, tens of towns were erased from the map and tens of thousands of homes were destroyed.
   
Tens of thousands of people were isolated in areas that were totally submerged under the flooded river waters, and they are threatened with famine and diseases.
 
169 bridges were destroyed in Honduras, 80 in Nicaragua and 28 in Guatemala, in addition to hundreds of kilometers of roads.
 
In El-Salvador, and according to the National Emergency Commission, 96 people were considered missing and 49275 were devastated, especially in the eastern part of the country.
 
Throughout Central America, tens of thousands of hectares of crops, especially rice and corn, considered the main foods of the population, as well as coffee and banana crops, the region's main exports, were damaged.
