State of Emergency Declared in Several Latin American Countries in Preparation for Hurricane "Mitch"
 
Tegucigalpa 10-27 (AFP) - Sources in Tegucigalpa reported that many Latin American countries are gearing up to face Hurricane "Mitch" - which weather forecasts consider the strongest hurricane of this century - and which was expected to reach "The Bay" Islands and the Honduras coasts the night of Monday-Tuesday.
  
The hurricane is moving from the north to the west at a speed of 13 km/hour, with wind speed exceeding 300 km/hour within a 110 km radius.

Security authorities declared a state of maximum emergency in Guatemala, which is located in the center of the hurricane. The Natural Disaster Coordination Authority reported in a statement issued in Guatemala City that "due to our proximity to the extremely violent hurricane with wind speed approaching 290 km/hour that may cause severe damages to the population, "We decided to declare a state of maximum emergency." 
 
A state of maximum emergency was also declared on the northern coast of Colombia, hundreds of kilometers away from the hurricane.

Civil defense sources reported the government of Honduras, which also declared a state of emergency, evacuated thousands of "The Bay" Islands and coastal areas residents.
  
It is to be mentioned that Hurricane "Fifi" killed more than ten thousand people in Honduras in 1972.
