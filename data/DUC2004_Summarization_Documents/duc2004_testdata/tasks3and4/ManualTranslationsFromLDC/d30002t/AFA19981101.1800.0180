Tegucigalpa's Mayor Killed in Helicopter Accident

Tegucigalpa 11-2 (AFP) - A military source in Honduras said that Tegucigalpa's Mayor, Cesar Armando, and three other persons were killed today, Sunday, in a crash of a military helicopter that was flying over the eastern province of the city that was subjected to Hurricane "Mitch."
  
The other victims are the head of the Infrastructure Department in Honduras' capital, Arturo Colonna, the pilot Jose Arnoldo Miranda and a photographer named Giovanni Sanchez.

The helicopter apparently crashed because of a technical malfunction while flying at a low altitude.

Witnesses reported that it turned into a "mass of smoke" when it crashed.

The mayor, who previously occupied the post of Minister of Health, was participating in assessing the damages caused by Hurricane Mitch and was at the same time helping deliver medications to the devastated areas.

He was personally involved over the last days in the rescue operations.
