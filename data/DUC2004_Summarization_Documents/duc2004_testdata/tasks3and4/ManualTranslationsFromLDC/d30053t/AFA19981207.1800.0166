Albright: Clinton's Visit to Gaza Does Not Constitute Recognition of Effort to Establish Independent State

Washington 12-7 (AFP) - The American Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, announced today, Monday, that President Clinton's visit next week to the Gaza Strip does not aim at recognizing the aspirations of the Palestinians to establish an independent state.

Albright said in a statement to reporters at the conclusion of a luncheon with the Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, "This is not the visit's objective."

She explained that Clinton's visit next Monday to Gaza, which is the first by an American president to the Palestinian Territories, "Comes under the framework of the Wye Plantation Accord and efforts aiming at moving the Israeli Palestinian peace process".
 
She went on to say, "There are no efforts for going beyond that in this regard, and, as we repeatedly said in the past, the subject of establishing the Palestinian state must be approached within the framework of negotiations over the final status" of the Palestinian Territories.

Sharon said, in turn, "We welcome President Clinton's visit," indicating that a declaration of a Palestinian state will be regarded "as a flagrant violation of the Wye and Oslo agreements."
 
The American president's plane will land at the new Gaza Airport, according to a statement by Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who will accompany him to Gaza for an official visit that will last a few hours, will receive him at the airport.

President Clinton is expected to arrive Saturday evening in Jerusalem for a four-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
 
Albright indicated that Clinton will stress during his talks with the Palestinian and Israeli sides the importance of always adopting diplomatic means.

She said, "Violence is not the solution and disagreement issues must be discussed together since no solutions can be reached except via negotiation."

Sharon, in turn, implicitly accused Arafat of inciting violence in the Palestinian Territories.  He said, "There is no doubt that the new Intifada, which was instigated and is supported by the Palestinian Authority, is in itself a great obstacle to resuming the peace process."
 
Official American sources reported that the American president may chair a meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

News about Clinton's visit to Gaza, which is considered by the Palestinians as a step toward recognition of the future Palestinian state, stirred fears in Israel who wishes to limit its impact to the lowest possible degree.
