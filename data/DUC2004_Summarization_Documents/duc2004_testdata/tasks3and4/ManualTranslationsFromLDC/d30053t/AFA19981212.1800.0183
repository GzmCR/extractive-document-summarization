Clinton Calls on Israelis, Palestinians to Implement Wye Plantation Accord
 
Ben Gurion Airport (Israel) 12-12 (AFP) - Upon his arrival this evening, Saturday, to the Hebrew state, American President Bill Clinton called on the Israelis and Palestinians to implement the Wye Plantation Accord.
  
In a speech delivered before the Israeli authorities who came to receive him at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, Clinton said that "the two sides are now facing the challenge of implementing the Wye Accord."
 
Clinton praised the agreement that was concluded at the end of last October and said, "I thought then that it was the better choice and I still think that today."

Clinton urged the peoples of the Middle East to continue on the road to peace "which is not an option among options but is the only option."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his accusations in front of Clinton against the Palestinian Authority for not respecting its part of the Wye Accord. He said, "In recent weeks, our partners did not respect their commitments." He added, "We demand that they now and forever stop from inciting violence and that they confront terrorism.  This way, we arrive at a peace based on security and equal treatment."
 
Netanyahu ascertained, "We are ready to implement the agreements that we signed. But we want the Palestinians to implement their part."
 
Clinton responded by reiterating the United States' commitment to the security of the state of Israel. He said, "We share the opinion that the large majority of Israelis will continue to oppose "a peace process without security." He affirmed, "At the same time, we believe that peace (...) is not only an option among other options but is the only possible option."
