Clinton Visits Rabin's Grave (Accompanied with photos)

Jerusalem 12-13 (AFP) - American President Bill Clinton placed today, Sunday, a stone from the Wye River on the grave of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated three years ago at the hands of a radical from the Israeli right.

Agence France Presse correspondent reported that Rabin's widow, Leah, received the American president, who was wearing the Jewish fedora and was accompanied by his wife, Hillary, at Hertzel Cemetery.

Clinton placed a stone on Rabin's grave, according to Jewish rituals, and two bouquets of flowers.

Clinton brought the stone from the Wye River, located parallel to the place where the Israeli-Palestinian meetings were held and concluded by signing the Wye Plantation Accord last October. Nevertheless, its implementation still faces great hurdles.
 
Rabin's widow told reporters before the arrival of Clinton that "the President was a great friend of my husband's and that optimism used to dominate their meeting after the Oslo Accord."

She added, "It is sad to see him return under these circumstances now optimism has evaporated," as a result of the hurdles that obstruct the peace process.

She expressed her hope for Clinton to win "over the dark forces" in his country, in an implicit reference to the internal problems plaguing the American president.

The House of Representatives, in which Republicans enjoy a majority, is due to meet next Thursday in a special session to vote on the four "articles of impeachment" that were passed by the Judicial Committee against Bill Clinton.

The American president is accused of lying under oath, obstructing justice and misusing power in the Lewinsky Scandal.

This is the second time Clinton visits Rabin's grave since he attended his funeral ceremonies in November 1995.
