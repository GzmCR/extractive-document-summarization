Israeli Ministers Concerned about Clinton's Visit to Gaza Next Week

Jerusalem 12-6 (AFP) - Israeli ministers expressed their concern today, Sunday, that American President Bill Clinton's visit to the Palestinian Territories in the middle of this month may be against Israel's interests.
  
The official Israeli radio said that Science Minister, Silvan Shalom, accused the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that he suggested to Clinton to visit the Gaza Strip.
 
A sharp verbal exchange ensued where the two officials exchanged accusations of responsibility for leaking information harmful to the government interests.

National Education Minister, Isaac Levi, in turn denounced Clinton's visit to Gaza, regarding that the latter is using his power to cover up "a Palestinian maneuver."
   
Levi (the radical right) added that the Palestinians do not intend to call for a meeting of the Palestinian National Congress (the highest authority in the Palestine Liberation Organization) where a quorum is attainable.
  
The Wye Plantation Accord, which was signed by the Palestinian and Israeli sides, calls for a meeting of the Palestinian National Congress next week in Gaza in the presence of Clinton to affirm the nullification of the anti-Israel articles from the Palestinian Charter.
