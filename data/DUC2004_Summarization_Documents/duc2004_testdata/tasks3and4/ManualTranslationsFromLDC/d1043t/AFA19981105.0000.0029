American Secretary of Defense Meets with Sultan Qaboos

Muscat 11-5 (AFP) - The Omani News Agency reported that the American Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, arrived today, Thursday, in the Sultanate of Oman where he met with Sultan Qaboos Bin Said and discussed with him the Iraqi crisis.

The Agency added that Sultan Qaboos stressed during the meeting "the importance of Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions and the need to address this issue according to Security Council resolutions."
 
Cohen arrived in Muscat coming from Doha, as part of a Gulf tour to hold consultations on the crisis stemming from Iraq's decision to stop cooperation with United Nations disarmament inspectors.

Cohen is expected to arrive later today in the Emirates, which is the last leg of his tour in which he also visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
 
Cohen had visited London, prior to the Gulf, where he warned Iraq, together with his British counterpart, George Robertson, that "all options are open" to force her to back down from her decision to stop cooperating with United Nations inspectors.

It should be noted that Cohen failed in a previous crisis with Iraq last February to obtain the support of the Gulf countries to carry out a military strike against Iraq.
