American Defense Secretary Arrives in Doha
 
Doha 11-4 (AFP) - The American Embassy in Doha announced that the American Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, arrived in Qatar today, Wednesday, as part of his Gulf tour to hold consultations with the United States allies on the crisis with Iraq.

The Embassy said that Cohen arrived in Doha coming from Bahrain, where he held talks with Crown Prince Sheikh Hamad Bin Issa Al Khalifa and Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa dealing with Iraq's decision to stop cooperation with United Nations disarmament inspectors.
 
Cohen had held talks in Kuwait this morning with the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah.

Prior to Kuwait, Cohen had visited Saudi Arabia where he held talks with the Saudi monarch, King Fahad Bin Abdel Aziz and the Crown Prince, Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz on "possible responses to the latest Iraqi defiance of the Security Council", as announced by the American Defense Department.

Diplomatic sources in Riyadh said that the Saudi leaders affirmed to the American Defense secretary that Saudi Arabia "supports a diplomatic solution" to the crisis.
 
Cohen will also visit the Sultanate of Oman and the Emirates before heading to Cairo tomorrow, Thursday.

Iraq had decided last Saturday to stop dealing with the United Nations Special Commission in charge of disarming Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.

Prior to the Gulf, Cohen had visited London where he warned, together with his British counterpart, George Robertson, that "all options are open" to force Iraq to back down from its decision.

The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Political Affairs, Thomas Bickering, and the Supreme Commander of the Central Command of the American Forces, General Anthony Zinni, are accompanying Cohen on his tour.

It should be noted that Cohen failed in a previous crisis with Iraq a year ago to obtain the support of the United States allies in the Gulf to carry out a military strike against Iraq.
