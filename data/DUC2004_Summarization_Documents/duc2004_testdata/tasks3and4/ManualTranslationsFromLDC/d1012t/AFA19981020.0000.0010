King Hussein's Doctors "Relieved" for his Response to Treatment
 
Rochester (United States) 10-20 (AFP) - The doctors of the Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, expressed their relief yesterday, Monday, for the way he is responding to treatment for cancer.
 
Jane Jacobs, the Mayo Clinic Hospital spokeswoman in Rochester, Minnesota, said that "the treatment is progressing as expected." She added that "doctors are relieved." 
  
King Hussein (62 years of age) arrived yesterday, Monday, in Washington, and he may interject in the on-going negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians at Wye Plantation, although his exact role still needs to be defined.

The spokeswoman added that King Hussein "is fine and his spirits are high." She said that he would return to the hospital later in the week, explaining that it is not the first time that he leaves the hospital since he began the fourth phase of treatment last July.

The spokeswoman refused to give her opinion on the Jordanian monarch's chances for recovery. She said, "We do not discuss the medical status of a patient unless he himself chose to disclose this information, which is not what His Majesty has decided to do."

An American diplomat pointed out that the Jordanian monarch presence in Wye Plantation can dispel the rumors about the deterioration of his health condition. An Israeli newspaper had confirmed that he is on the verge of death, which was denied by both Washington and Amman.
