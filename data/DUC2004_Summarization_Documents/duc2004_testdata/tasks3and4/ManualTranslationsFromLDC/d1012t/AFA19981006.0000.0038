King Hussein Begins Fourth Phase of Chemotherapy

Amman 10-6 (AFP) - Jordan's Prime Minister, Fayez Al-Tarawneh, said that King Hussein, who has been at the American Mayo Clinic Hospital since mid July, began the fourth phase of chemotherapy yesterday, Monday, and he has but two phases left to fight the lymphatic node cancer.

In statements to the press upon arrival in Amman yesterday evening from Mayo Clinic in Rochester (State of Minnesota) where King Hussein has returned, Al-Tarawneh said that King Hussein "began yesterday the fourth phase of treatment, and he is enjoying good health and responding in an excellent manner under the intense medical supervision and continuous evaluation procedures."
 
State television showed the day before yesterday scenes from King Hussein's meeting with the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Royal Court, Jawad Al-Anani, and the Foreign Minister, Abdul Elah Al-Khatib.
   
The Jordanian monarch is expected to return home in the first half of next November, on the eve of his sixty-third birthday, which falls on the 14 of November.

Al-Tarawneh pointed out that "the intense medical supervision was one of the reasons that delayed the fourth phase for several days. However, after consulting with a large number of specialists, who come from the most prominent medical centers in the United States, and their evaluation of his medical status, they unanimously agreed yesterday that the king continue this phase the same way and according to the treatment schedule." 

The Jordanian monarch confirmed on September 20 that he had completed the third out of six phases of chemotherapy prescribed for him by his doctors at Mayo Clinic. Each treatment period extends over four days and is separated between one another by three weeks.

King Hussein was admitted to the American specialist hospital after he suffered sweating spells and rise in temperatures. Doctors diagnosed his condition to be lymphatic node cancer.
