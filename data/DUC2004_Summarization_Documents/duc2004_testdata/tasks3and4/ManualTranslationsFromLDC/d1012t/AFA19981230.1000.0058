Talks Between King Hussein and Clinton Next Week

Amman 12-30 (AFP) - A high-level Jordanian official told Agence France Presse that Jordanian Monarch King Hussein who arrived in Washington yesterday, Tuesday, will meet with American President Bill Clinton at the beginning of next week.

The Jordanian official, who asked for not revealing his identity, said that "King Hussein will meet with President Clinton on Monday or Tuesday to review the latest developments in the region and bilateral relations."

The Jordanian Crown Prince, Prince Hassan Bin Talal, had announced yesterday, Tuesday, that King Hussein left the Mayo Clinic Hospital in the United States, following the completion of various phases of treatment for the cancer disease.

Jordan's Crown Prince, King Hussein's younger brother, said, "While you are listening to these words, Al Hussein would have left the hospital (...), healed and cured of the disease. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic Hospital have allowed him to leave following the completion of treatment that was crowned with total success."
 
The Jordanian monarch (63 years of age) was admitted to the Mayo Clinic Hospital in the American state of Minnesota last July 14, following his infliction of lymphatic node cancer.

Following six rounds of chemotherapy, King Hussein's doctors announced last month that he was completely cured of the disease. He was subjected after that to re-implanting of the bone marrow as a precautionary measure.

An official source said that King Hussein will spend a week in Washington before leaving to London. He is expected to return to Amman around the twentieth of next January.

The Jordanian monarch had affirmed yesterday in a letter read by Prince Hassan that he will spend "a few days in Washington before he leaves to London then to Amman. King Hussein indicated that the reason for taking some time off on the way is for recovery as the start of regaining vigor and energy to their normal levels."
