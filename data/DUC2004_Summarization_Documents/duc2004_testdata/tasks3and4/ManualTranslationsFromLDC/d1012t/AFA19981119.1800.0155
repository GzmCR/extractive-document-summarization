Precautionary Protective Phase of King Hussein's Treatment Program to End Middle of Next Month

Amman 11-19 (AFP) - Jordan's Prime Minister, Fayez Al-Tarawneh, said that King Hussein, who finished five rounds of chemotherapy against cancer in the United States, will return to Rochester hospital on Sunday to take a "protective" final dose that ends in the middle of next December.

In statements to the press upon his return today, Thursday, from a short visit to King Hussein at his place of recovery, Al-Tarawneh explained that the Jordanian monarch "will return on Sunday to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester (State of Minnesota) to start the protective" phase", the sixth and final one.

He emphasized that "this phase comes under the understanding of safe medical technologies, which requires complete rest during this period that will last till the middle of next month, then the king will spend a convalescence period after which he will return safe and sound to the homeland by the end of next month." 

The Jordanian monarch had announced at his 63rd birthday on November 14 that he completely got rid of the lymphatic node cancer and that he will be able to return home soon.

He explained then that the Mayo Clinic doctors "were preparing my bone marrow for implant so that whatever traces that may have been left of the disease can be eliminated."
 
After he conveyed the Hashemite monarch's thanks and appreciation for everyone who visited him in the United States, Jordan's Prime Minister expressed hope that the public and Parliamentary sectors refrain from visiting King Hussein at his hospital "because the meeting with His Majesty, the king, will take place in Jordan soon, God willing."

Finally, Al-Tarawneh said that he briefed King Hussein on a ministerial statement that will be delivered by the Prime Minister on the Sunday before the People's Congress, which has been extraordinarily called to convene by a royal decree, according to the constitution, to exclusively discuss the matter of the king's absence from the country.
 
He affirmed that the Jordanian monarch, who went to the United States last July 14, "has approved the statement in its final format."

The Jordanian constitution states that "... in the event that the King's absence lasts for more than four months and the People's Congress is not in session, it shall be called to convene immediately to look into the matter."
