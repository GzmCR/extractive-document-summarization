Aliyev Proclaims Win in First Round of Presidential Elections in Azerbaijan

Baku 10-13 (AFP) - Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev, whose term is ending, proclaimed today, Tuesday, his win in the first round of the presidential elections by obtaining about 75 percent of the votes, but the Central Elections Committee has not yet released the results.

The president said, "My information indicates that I received 75% of votes", and added, "The Azerbaijanis elected a president for themselves, and the Election Commission will announce the results in a few days."
  
International observers, particularly those from the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe, pointed to the many irregularities during the course of the election process.

President Aliyev (75 years of age), who is competing with five other candidates, had to win two-thirds of the votes in order to be elected in the first round directly.
 
His main competitor, Democratic candidate Etibar Mammadov, hopes to force Aliyev to go into the second round of the elections.

Earlier, Mammadov had announced his intention to file a lawsuit before the Constitutional Court in the event of an Aliyev win in the first round. Estimates by Observers indicate that Aliyev will win by about 60% of the votes. 

A candidate must obtain at least two-thirds of the votes (more than 67 percent) in order to win by the first round of the elections.
