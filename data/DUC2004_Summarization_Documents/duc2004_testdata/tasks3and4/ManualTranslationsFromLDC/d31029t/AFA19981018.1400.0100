Heydar Aliyev Takes Oath of Office for Second Term Despite Opposition Rejection of Elections Results
 
Baku 10-18 (AFP) - Azerbaijani President, Heydar Aliyev, took the oath of office for a second term today, Sunday, despite the opposition's refusal to recognize his win and accusations of wide-scale rigging of the presidential elections in this oil-rich former Soviet republic.

Aliyev's main opponent, the former Soviet dissident Etibar Mammadov, demands holding a second round, affirming that Aliyev did not obtain more than the two thirds of votes required for winning in the first round.
 
Aliyev's win was declared in the eleventh of October's elections by a majority of 71.11% of votes, but his opponents accused him of rigging the results.

Aliyev, a former general in the Soviet intelligence service (KGB) and a prominent figure in the Communist Party, took the oath of office on the Koran and on the constitution vowing to defend Azerbaijan's independence as well as the integrity and security of its territories.

He then knelt to kiss the Azerbaijani flag before five thousand guests, including the Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and the Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
 
Russian President Boris Putin sent a letter of congratulations to Aliyev.
