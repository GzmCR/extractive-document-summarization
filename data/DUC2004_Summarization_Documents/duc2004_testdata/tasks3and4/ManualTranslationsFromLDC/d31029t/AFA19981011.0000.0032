Aliyev Casts Vote, Attacks Opponent Mammadov

Baku 10-11 (AFP) - Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev, who is considered the most likely to win the presidential elections, cast his vote today, Sunday, at one of the polling centers near his residence in the center of the capital and took the opportunity to attack his main opponent, Etibar Mammadov. 
   
The president, who was elected in September 1993, said in a statement to reporters that "one of the candidates, and you know who I mean, asserts that he has a team and a program, but when the country was on the verge of civil war in 1993, Etibar Mammadov was involved in the political scene so why did he not do anything and why did he not try to stop" the tragedy.

He went on, soon after arriving at the center amidst the drum beats of children wearing the traditional dress, "I have a team and it is better than his team."

He then started speaking about his projects and said, "I want freedom for Azerbaijanis, and I will strengthen independence, develop the economy and resolve all pending problems.  We did a lot, but there is still a lot to be done." 

He renewed his attack on "the forces that seek to destabilize the authority", in an apparent reference to the opposition that is led by his predecessor, Abu Al Fadhl Al Shibi, who is boycotting the elections. He said, "God is here and He protected me (during the attacks), and He is always on the side of justice (...).  He is helping us today because the weather is nice and will let people vote quietly (...). I hope people will vote for the bright future of Azerbaijan."

In a school converted to a polling center, Etibar Mammadov (National Independence Party) cast his vote this morning, Sunday.

Experts say that this candidate of 44 years of age may cause a second round of elections to be held.

To be elected in the first round, as he hopes, Aliyev must get two-thirds of the votes with a turnout rate estimated to be at least 25%.

At 9:00 local time (6:00 GMT), two hours after the polling centers had been opened, 8.8% of voters, or 372529 people out of 4.21 million voters, cast their votes throughout the country, according to the Independent Center for Democratic Elections, which is under the Election Commission.
 
Polling offices are expected to close their doors, in this small country that is situated by the banks of the Caspian Sea, at 20:00 (17:00 GMT).

It is to be mentioned that about 180 observers, under the auspices of the Security and Cooperation Organization, are charged with supervising the process of voting.

During the legislative elections that were held in 1995, many rigging incidents were recorded.
