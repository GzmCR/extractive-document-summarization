Margaret Thatcher Demands Pinochet's Release
 
London 10-21 (AFP) - Former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, demanded this evening, Wednesday, the immediate release of General Augusto Pinochet, who was detained last Friday in London at the request of the Spanish judicial authorities.
 
In a letter to "The Times" newspaper, to be published in its issue for tomorrow, Thursday, Margaret Thatcher, who received Pinochet at her house two weeks ago, said that help extended by the "Chilean Senator-for-life" to the British people contributed to the shortening of the Falkland's War against Argentina in 1982, consequently saving the lives of a large number of Britons.
 
After she reminded of the visit by Argentine President Carlos Menem to London next week, Thatcher thought that "it is scandalous to reconcile with and detain the one who worked during the very war to save the lives of Britons."

She demanded "the return of the General to his country immediately."
