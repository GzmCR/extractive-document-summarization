Chilean Plane Lands at British Base

London 10-25 (AFP) - A Defense Ministry's spokesman said today, Sunday, that a Chilean transport plane was allowed yesterday, Saturday, to land and make a stop at the British Royal Air Force's Brize Norton Base near London.

The spokesman added that "the motives for this flight are the business of the Chileans alone, and must not be interpreted as a decision in this or that direction with regards to General Pinochet's case which "is no longer in the domain of the British government."

He explained that "the Chileans received permission to use the airspace according to normal procedures."

Santiago's newspapers had reported today that a Chilean air force plane was dispatched to London carrying all necessary medical equipment to return General Pinochet, who has been detained since October 16 at a hospital in London after he underwent a surgery.
 
Short clashes took place in front of the hospital today when the right-wing Chilean Senator Ignacio Perez Quiron left the building. The senator responded with a rude gesture to the demonstrators who are demanding trying the former dictator, when four demonstrators chased the senator, but police stopped them.
 
Scotland Yard said no one was arrested. 

Supposedly, General Pinochet's lawyers, who consider his detention illegal, will appear before the Supreme Court in London in a legal battle to try to have him released. The first session, which was due to be held last Thursday, was postponed to give the parties time to prepare their arguments.
 
The Spanish justice system, in turn, will decide on its jurisdiction in pursuing the former Chilean dictator, whose extradition is demanded by Judge Garzon.
