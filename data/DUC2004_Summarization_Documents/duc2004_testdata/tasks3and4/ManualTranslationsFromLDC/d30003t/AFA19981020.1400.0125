Robin Cook Dismisses Any British Government Intervention in Pinochet Case

Sofia 10-20 (AFP) - British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said today, Tuesday, in Sofia that the Pinochet case must be addressed "in accordance with the law," and dismissed any intervention by his government in the course of justice.
 
Cook told reporters, in response to a question on the likelihood of surrendering the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, that "the legislative branch is totally separated from the government, and governmental institutions do not have the right to exert pressure on the courts. Everything must proceed according to legislations."

General Pinochet (82 years of age) was placed under detention in London last Friday at the request of two Spanish judges who intend to charge him with committing "crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture" on the basis of the disappearance of 94 persons, mostly Chileans of Spanish origin. The two judges have a period of 40 days to file a request to hand over Pinochet, which requires the endorsement of the Spanish government.
  
Cook is paying a one-day visit to Sofia.
