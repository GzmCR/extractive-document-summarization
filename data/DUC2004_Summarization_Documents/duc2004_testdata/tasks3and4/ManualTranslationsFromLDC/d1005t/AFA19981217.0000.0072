Poll: Americans Believe Clinton's Impeachment Proceeding Will Not Pass Through Senate

Washington 12-17 (AFP) - An opinion poll published today, Thursday, showed that the majority of Americans are convinced that the House of Representatives will vote for impeaching President Bill Clinton but the Senate will reject it.

The poll, which was published by the Washington Post newspaper and the "ABC" television network, showed that 67% of those included in the poll believe that the House of Representatives will support impeaching Clinton.
 
While 30% believe the contrary and contend that the impeachment will not go to the Senate.
 
57% expressed their support for a censure vote against Clinton while 36% supported the impeachment proceeding.

In response to a question on whether the Senate will decide to remove Clinton at the end of his trial, 60% responded with a no versus 37% who expressed an opposite opinion.

Yet, 57% of those included in the poll expressed their belief that Clinton ought to submit his resignation before he is tried by the Senate.

An opinion poll conducted by the Washington Post and "ABC" last week had shown that 58% support Clinton's resignation if the impeachment proceeding went to the Senate.
 
The incoming Senate Republican "President", Bob Livingston, announced that because of the air strikes against Iraq, he granted a brief delay to Clinton, explaining that the discussion on impeachment will take place "perhaps on Friday or perhaps on Saturday, but in the near future in any case."
