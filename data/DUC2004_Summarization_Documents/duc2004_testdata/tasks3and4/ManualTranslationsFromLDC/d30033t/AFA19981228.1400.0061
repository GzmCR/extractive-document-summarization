Tokyo: Euro Will be Strong Against Dollar
 
Paris 12-28 (AFP) - Japanese Deputy Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara said in an interview with the French newspaper "Le Monde" published today, Monday, that the probability of "the unified European currency competing against the dollar" is very big.

Sakakibara}, who affirmed that "it is very difficult at this stage to assess the impact the Euro would have on the yen or the dollar," stressed the fact that "stability among major hard currencies - the dollar, the Euro and the yen, will be preliminary in 1999."

The Japanese Deputy Finance Minister said, "We must stabilize this trilateral relation between the Euro, the dollar and the yen, but as far as we are concerned, we have to consolidate the relation with the Euro." He expressed his hope to discuss this matter with the Europeans because the relation between the yen and the Euro, in his opinion, will become "at the same level of importance as the relation between the yen and the dollar."
 
Sakakibara also announced that the Euro, which will be launched on the 1st of next January, will be a "big success" despite "a number of issues matter that are difficult to resolve particularly as far as taxes are concerned."
