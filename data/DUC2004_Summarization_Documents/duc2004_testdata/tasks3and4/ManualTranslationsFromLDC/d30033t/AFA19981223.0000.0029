European Central Bank Sets Primary Interest Rates in Preparation for Euro
  
Frankfurt 12-23 (AFP) - The European Central Bank established yesterday, Tuesday, the level of the interest rates it will use in managing the currency policy in countries that will adopt the unified European currency (Euro) starting on the first of January 1999.
 
The primary interest rate was set at 3% in the "European System of Central Banks", and that rate is the "primary re-financing interest rate" (refi).

This interest rate is supposed to allow banks to obtain liquidity on a weekly basis that will be due within two weeks in exchange for financial securities deposited at the European Central Bank.

European Central Bank Chairman Vim Duesenburg stressed in a press conference held in Frankfurt yesterday evening, Tuesday, the bank's effort to guarantee financial stability in the Euro region.

He said that "the 3% rate is a very low rate historically. The European Central Bank does not want to give any impression of the possibility for interest rate reduction in a near future."

The European Central Bank decided, as a precautionary step, to control the interest rate "refi" in a transitional phase that lasts three weeks within a very tight range when it set a lower ceiling of 2.75% and a upper ceiling of 3.25%. At the end of the three weeks, the difference will be more natural (2% and 5.4%).

This tight range is supposed to prevent large movements in the already shaken market due to the move to the Euro.

Duesenburg assured the markets by saying that "the Euro will be launched, at least as far as Europe is concerned, under the best economic conditions. There is no doubt that we would be happy if the international climates were calmer, but the world crisis did not affect the move to the Euro."

Despite expressing relief for the stability in the Euro region, Duesenburg warned against some confusion in the markets, especially the danger of a big increase in wages. He repeated his call for governments to balance their budgets.
