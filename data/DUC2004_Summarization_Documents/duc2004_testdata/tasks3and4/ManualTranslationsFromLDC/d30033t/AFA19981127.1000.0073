By Harvey Clair &HT; Euro Launch Golden Opportunity for Counterfeiters

Leon (France) 11-27 (AFP) - The launch of the Euro, even though it is one of the most protected currencies in the world, provides excellent opportunities for counterfeiters. Banking experts and police forces in European countries have started from now studying the situation and finding solutions to address it.

Neil Goodman, a counterfeit expert at Interpol, which is based in Leon, thinks that "in the beginning, the Euro may be subjected to counterfeit operations than even more than the dollar."
 
During an international symposium in Leon this week that drew more than 250 representatives from banking circles and police, many experts from Latin American and African countries, which have been facing an influx of counterfeit dollars into their countries for many years, expressed their concern about the possibility of the arrival of large counterfeit quantities of the unified European currency.   

With the start of the Euro circulation on the first of January 2002, currency counterfeiters will have two ways to hone in: - Currency counterfeiters may take advantage of a period, which may extend for six months, for exchanging national currencies with Euros, in order to pass the largest possible amount of the counterfeit currency, part of which may have already been in existence, since checking procedures will not be strict due to the vast amounts of money that will be exchanged in a short period.
  
- They will also take advantage of people's lack of awareness of the features of the new banknotes.

Neil Goodman explains that "the better people are familiar with their currency, the more protected this currency is," adding, "It is difficult in all of that to make currency users examine the banknotes they receive."

Central banks and police in European countries intend to launch a wide awareness campaign before the advent of 2002, aiming at demonstrating to people the features of the new banknotes.

Experts find themselves facing a dilemma with regard to the campaign's start date: If the campaign starts very early, currency counterfeiters will be the first beneficiaries of the information it provides, and will go to work immediately. However, if the campaign is very late, people will not be able to recognize the counterfeit notes.
 
Police and financial institutions will significantly bolster their cooperation to confront the dangers of counterfeiting the Euro.

Two banks will provide data in this regard, one for technical and statistical data on currency counterfeiting (confiscation dates and the nature of the counterfeited currency...), and the other provides police with all available information on suspects.

The Euro will be privileged with the most sophisticated anti-counterfeiting technologies in the world: magnetized ink, changing-color ink, raised images and a security metallic wire.
 
The European Central Bank intends to print 30 billion pieces of the Euro's banknotes in 11 European countries.

Sadiq Ghradyeh, organizer of the Leon symposium, said that this matter constitutes a huge "duel" between police elements and counterfeiters, explaining that after the end of national currency circulation, this duel will end "and the losing side will be the one who has the last of the counterfeit banknotes" without being able to exchange it.
