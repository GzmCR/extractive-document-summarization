British Lord Looks into Copts' Conditions in Egypt

Cairo 11-26 (AFP) - The Catholic Coptic "Countryside Society" announced today, Thursday, that a British lord, who had threatened to wage a campaign against tourism in Egypt in response to "torturing Copts", will visit the country to look into the conditions of Christians in it.  

The society's chairman, Amin Fahim, said in a statement that he met with Lord Elton yesterday, Wednesday, at the House of Lords in London and that the latter accepted his invitation to visit Egypt to see "for himself the actual conditions" of Copts. 

Fahim, whose non-governmental society undertakes educational and developmental programs in Egypt's countryside, said that the timing and itinerary of the visit will be determined later.

The liberal "Al Wafd" opposition newspaper had published in early November the text of a letter Lord Elton addressed to Egyptian officials in which he threatened to "wage a war on Egyptian tourism" if the government did not refrain from "repressing Copts."
 
The letter came after the British "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper published an article headlined, "Egyptian Police Crucify, Rape Christians." The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights had published in September a report on the subjecting of many residents of Al-Koshah village in Egypt's countryside to torture at the hands of policemen during a double-murder investigation.
 
Pope Shnouda III, the Orthodox Copts' Patriarch, confirmed that a number of the village's residents were victims of "excesses and assaults" committed by policemen and rejected outside interference in Egyptian affairs.
