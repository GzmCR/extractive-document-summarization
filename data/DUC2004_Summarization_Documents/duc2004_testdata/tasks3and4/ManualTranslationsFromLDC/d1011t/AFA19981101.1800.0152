(Corrected repeat of news item number 161) Hosni Mubarak Accuses Israel of Implicitly Standing Behind Press Campaign on Subjecting to Egypt's Copts Discrimination Sharm El Sheikh 11-1 (AFP) - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak accused Israel today, Sunday, of implicitly standing behind the press campaign which says that Copts are subject to discrimination in Egypt.

Mubarak affirmed that a report issued "every week or every month, I believe" by the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the discrimination against Copts "gives an indication whether they are behind this matter or not?"

He told reporters at the Sharm El Sheik resort on the Red Sea, "Who wrote in England" (Christina Lamp, author of the article which was published by the "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper issued last Sunday) "they (the Israelis) know her very well."

He added, "Whenever something happens, they (sources not identified by the president) push it on us, but that does not bother us because the situation is very clear." He said amusingly, "Torture used to happen before Christ's birth, but now it absolutely does not happen." 

The British newspaper had reported under the headline "Egyptian Police Crucify, Rape Christians", that Copts of Al-Koshah (500 km south of Cairo) were subjected during August to savage practices by the Egyptian police.

In a report published at the end of last August, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights indicated that police "collectively punished" the village's residents during interrogations dealing with the murder of two Coptic young men on the 14 of August.
