Pope Shnouda Rejects Foreign Interference in Affairs of Egypt's Copts 

Cairo 11-6 (AFP) - The Copts' Patriarch, Pope Shnouda III, affirmed today, Friday, his rejection of foreign interference in the affairs of the Copts of Egypt and stressed the solidarity between her Christians and Moslems in the aftermath of accusations directed against the police for torturing Christians in a countryside village.

Pope Shnouda said in a statement, "We do not accept foreign interference in our internal affairs, which we are resolving quietly with officials in our country."

He added that "what was reported in the foreign media" on Al-Koshah village (500 kilometers south of Cairo), where reportedly a large number of its citizens were subjected to torture at the hands of the police, "was extremely exaggerated and hurts Egypt's reputation, which we cannot accept."

Pope Shnouda stressed that the village located in the Sohag Governance did not witness "any sectarian subversion, nor any sectarian dispute between Moslems and Christians, and the relationship between them is quite good.
 
The Pope affirmed that what happened were "excesses and assaults by some police officers while investigating" a "normal" capital murder that targeted two Christians last August 14.
 
Pope Shnouda expressed his relief for Egyptian Interior Minister Habib Al-Adli's decision yesterday, Thursday, to transfer four Al Balina Station's high-ranking officers, the village's jurisdiction, from their locations to administrative positions by saying that "the Interior Minister took decisive action against those who committed excesses, and that the Prosecutor-General's office is underatking the investigation."

Al-Koshah's events had surfaced after the British "Sunday Telegraph" newspaper published last October 25 an article in which it accused Egyptian police of "crucifying and raping Copts."
  
The article outraged Egyptian officials who accused the newspaper of spreading lies for the aim of hurting Egypt as part of a campaign in which Israel was implicitly accused of being involved.

The names of the four officers who were transferred from their positions, two with the rank of lieutenant colonels, a third with the rank of major and a fourth with the rank of captain, were mentioned in testimonies of Copts subjected to torture and published in a report by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights issued on September 28.

The report discussed excesses committed by the police against many of the village's residents whom it said were subjected to torture by beating and electric shock while being interrogated in the capital murder.
