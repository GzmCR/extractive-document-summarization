Boutros Ghali in Television Series on National Unity Between Moslems and Copts in Egypt

Cairo 11-15 (AFP) - Egyptian television is preparing to film a television series that highlights the unity and cohesion of Moslems and Copts as the single fabric of the Egyptian society, exemplifying in particular the story of former United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Ghali.

Mohammad Galal Abd Al-Kawi, author of the 15-episode series "The Priest and the Sheikh", says in a conversation with Agence France Presse today, Sunday, that he wrote these episodes "to respond to the biased campaigns in some Western media outlets, which are being directed by Jews, for the purpose of inciting subversion between Moslems and Copts."

He added that these 15 separate episodes "highlight, with historical events, the national unity and cohesion between Moslems and Copts since the era of Amr Bin Al-Aas (the Arab leader who conquered Egypt in the year 639) and until Boutros Ghali assumed the post of United Nations Secretary-General.
 
He explained that Egypt nominated Ghali officially for this post, hence affirming that she supports her citizens, whether they were Moslems or Copts.
 
He said that the episodes also show "the Copt's rejection of the British colonial power's attempts to incite sectarian subversion amidst the 1919 revolution, which was distinguished by the standing of Moslems and Copts on one side in the face of the colonial power."
 
The British weekly "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper had published last October an article in which it affirmed that Copts were subjected to "crucifixion" in the village of Al-Koshah in the countryside.

Pope Shnouda III, the Copts' Patriarch, rejected this foreign interference in the affairs of the Copts of Egypt, stressing the solidarity between her Christians and Moslems by saying, "We do not accept foreign interference in our internal affairs, which we are resolving quietly with officials in our country."

He added that "what was reported in the foreign media" on Al-Koshah village "was extremely exaggerated and hurts Egypt's reputation, which we do not accept."

Pope Shnouda stressed that the village located in the Sohag Governance did not witness "any sectarian subversion, nor any sectarian dispute between Moslems and Christians, and the relationship between them is quite good.

The Pope affirmed that what happened were "excesses and assaults by some police officers while investigating" a "normal" capital murder that targeted two Christians last August 14.
