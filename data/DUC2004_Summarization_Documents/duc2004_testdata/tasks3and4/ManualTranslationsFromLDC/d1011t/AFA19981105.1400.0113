Four Police Officers Transferred in Investigation of Torture Cases at Egyptian Village

Cairo 11-5 (AFP) - The Egyptian Interior Minister, Habib Al-Adli, decided today, Thursday, to transfer four police officers from their place of work, as part of the investigation of charges directed against them in particular, and against the police in general, for torturing Copts from Al-Koshah village in the Sohag Governance (500 kilometers south of Cairo).
 
A security source said that Lieutenant Colonel Hani Gamal, Director of the Intelligence Service of Al Balina Station, which is Al-Koshah's jurisdiction; Lieutenant Colonel Ashraf Hussein Criminal Investigation Deputy; Major Islam Mohammad; and Captain Mohammad Mansour were transferred to administrative positions in the Governance "to guarantee the impartiality of the investigations" regarding charges of torture that took place in the aftermath of  murdering two Copts.
 
The source said that the officers were transferred "to guarantee their non-interference or non-influence on the investigation proceedings, which are being conducted by the Prosecutor-General's office on the Al-Koshah incident that resulted in the death of two Copts at the hands of a Copt" last August.

A security source in the Sohag Governance said in turn that the officers were transferred "because they did not handle the problem wisely."

A number of Al-Koshah residents had accused the four officers by name of torturing them in testimonies brought about in an Egyptian Organization for Human Rights report issued on September 28, 

The residents spoke in their testimonies about being subjected to torture by beating, electric shock and hanging from a ceiling fan during their interrogation about the capital murder.
 
Al-Koshah events had surfaced after the British newspaper "Sunday Telegraph" published an article last October 25 in which it accused the Egyptian police
of "crucifying and raping Copts."

The article outraged Egyptian officials who accused the newspaper of spreading lies aiming at hurting Egypt.

The security source said, on the other hand, that the forensic medicine report denied the contention of ten Copts about being subjected to torture. The report said that the injuries of those are the result of "old skin diseases."
 
The source said that three of those were referred to medical examination to verify the source of injuries in their noses and eyes.

A statement was issued in Cairo today, Thursday, bearing the signatures of two thousand Coptic public figures, clergymen, businessmen and entertainers, denouncing "the continuing efforts of the anti-Egypt dark forces (...) to spread false claims about persecuting Copts."
 
The statement affirmed that Copts "practice their rites freely in Egypt," and if "there were secondary issues regarding the treatment of Copts, they deal with specific individuals and cannot be attributed to government policy."

The statement, which was received by France Presse, condemned the act "of intruders in bringing up a fabricated issue in their names in order to tarnish the image of the people and government of Egypt before the international community."
