Legislative Elections in Syria Next November 30

Damascus 10-18 (AFP) - A decree issued by Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad today, Sunday, announced that the legislative elections will be held next November 30 to elect new members in the People's Congress (the Parliament).

The decree explained that representatives from 15 Syrian governances must be elected to occupy the congress seats numbered at 250, including 127 belonging to "laborers and farmers" and 123 "to other classes of people."
  
This allocation is identical to the seat allocation in the Parliament, the term of which had expired last September 9. It should be noted that the congress term in Syria is four years.
 
It should be mentioned that during the last legislative elections in August 1994, the ruling coalition in Syria, "The Progressive National Front", gained 167 seats out of the 250 the congress is comprised of.

All candidates of the coalition, which encompasses seven parties including the Baath Party, have been elected, while the independent representatives gained 83 seats.
