Yemeni Security Official: Foreign Tourists Kidnappers Belong to Yemeni "Islamic Jihad" Group

Sana'a 12-29 (AFP) - An official of Abyan police, where 16 Western tourists are being held since yesterday, Monday, announced that the hostages are held by the Yemeni "Islamic Jihad" group, who is demanding the release of its leader and lifting the embargo on Iraq.
 
The Yemeni security official announced that "the kidnappers are members in the Islamic Jihad."

This is the first time an Islamic group claims responsibility for the kidnapping operation in Yemen where tribes usually conduct such operations.

The security official, who asked to remain anonymous, added that the kidnappers "are demanding the release of their leader Saleh Haidara Al-Atwani and the lifting of the embargo on Iraq."

He explained that Al-Atwani was detained two weeks ago after armed clashes between individuals from the Islamic Jihad group and Yemeni security forces in the Abyan region, more than 400 km south of Sana'a.
 
The Yemeni Islamic Jihad group emerged in 1992, and it is comprised of old warriors from Afghanistan. The group owns a training camp in the Abyan mountains, and its members number is estimated at about 200 persons.

12 Brits, two American and two Australian tourists, who were taking a tour of Yemen, were kidnapped yesterday, Monday, at the hands of twenty armed men in the Abyan region.
