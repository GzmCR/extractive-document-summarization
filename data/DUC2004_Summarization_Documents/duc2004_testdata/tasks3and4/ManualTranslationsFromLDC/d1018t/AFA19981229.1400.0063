Three Western Tourists Killed During Attempt to Free Them

Sana'a 12-29 (AFP) - A Yemeni security official reported that Yemeni security forces killed three of the Western hostages who were held in Yemen, two Brits and an American, and managed to free 13 others when they attacked the place where they were detained.

Two of the kidnappers were also killed during the attack.

Security forces arrested the entire group of kidnappers, which on Monday captured 16 Western tourists, 12 Brits, two Americans and two Australians, in the Abyan region.

Police had earlier announced that the "Islamic Jihad" group kidnapped the Western tourists and demanded the release of its leader in addition to lifting the embargo imposed upon Iraq.

This is the first time a hostage kidnapping operation in Yemen ends up with the infliction of fatalities.

Some 150 foreigners were kidnapped in Yemen in the past few years, and they were released without shedding any blood.

This is also the first time an Islamic group conducts a kidnapping operation in Yemen, where armed tribes usually conduct such operations.

Police said that the kidnappers "are demanding the release of their leader Saleh Haidara Al-Atwani and the lifting of the embargo on Iraq, which was imposed by the United Nations in the year 1990."
