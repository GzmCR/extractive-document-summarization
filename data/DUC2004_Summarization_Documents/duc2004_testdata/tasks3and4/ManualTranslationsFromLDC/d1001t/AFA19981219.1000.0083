Baghdad 12-19 (AFP) - At least 68 Iraqi civilians were killed since Wednesday as a result of the American and British bombing on Iraq, as reported by an Iraqi official during their funerals today, Saturday, in Baghdad.

Representative Sultan Al-Shawi said during a funeral held for the victims, "They were all civilians killed during the savage bombing."

The funeral procession headed to the headquarters of the United Nations Development Program in Baghdad, where funeral goers held banners denouncing the Americans as "enemies of God."
