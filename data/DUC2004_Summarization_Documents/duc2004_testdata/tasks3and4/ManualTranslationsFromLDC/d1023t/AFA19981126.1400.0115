Barazan Al-Takriti Ready to Return to Baghdad

Geneva 11-26 (AFP) - An informed source in Bern confirmed today, Thursday, that Barazan Al-Takriti, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother and his country's former Ambassador to the United Nations, is ready to return to Baghdad at the end of this month.

The spokesman for the Swiss Federal Bureau for Foreigners (I repeat... for Foreigners), Christoph Mueller, told Agence France Presse, "We have information from confirmed sources that Al-Takriti is getting ready to leave Switzerland to Baghdad on the 30 of this month."    

The spokesman explained that the former ambassador, whose wife died from an acute illness a short while ago, obtained guarantees to return to Switzerland to visit his children, who will stay in the Canton of Geneva for at least a few months.

Barazan has eight children, some of whom are studying in Switzerland. Al-Takriti had earlier filed an application with the Canton of Geneva's authorities for granting his six children who live with him in Geneva "a residency vacation for a short period."

Mueller said that the Federal Bureau in Bern received this application on November 16, but the death of Al-Takriti's wife is forcing the Geneva authorities to reformulate the dossier, which has delayed its review.

But it was learned in Bern that the application will apparently be considered positively "unless new events develop."

The Federal Foreign Ministry in Bern, in turn, said today, Thursday, that it did not receive an application to extend the Iraqi ambassador's residency, indicating that the three-month diplomatic grace period granted him expires next Monday.
  
On the fifth of last August, Barazan, who assumed his post in Geneva in February 1989, notified the Swiss authorities that his mission will end at the end of this very month. 

Barazan had declared to the Saudi "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat" Newspaper his desire to stay in Switzerland for family reasons following his transfer to Baghdad as part of a diplomatic reorganization move ordered by the Iraqi president.

Iraq's mission to the United Nations in Geneva denied that Barazan Al-Takriti had dissented, as the Iraqi opposition has inferred.
 
Press reports mentioned that the Iraqi ambassador had been refusing to return to Iraq because of his bad relations with Oday, the Iraqi president's eldest son.

Al-Takriti, who did not return to Iraq since 1990, accepted condolences for his wife's death during the past three days at the Iraqi embassy, according to someone close to the family.
 
Al-Takriti's wife was the sister of Sajeda Telfah, the wife of the Iraqi president.
