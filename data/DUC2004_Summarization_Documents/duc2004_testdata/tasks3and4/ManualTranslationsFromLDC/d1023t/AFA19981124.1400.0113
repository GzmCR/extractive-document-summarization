Broad Diplomatic Reorganizations in Iraq

Baghdad 11-24 (AFP) - An Iraqi official announced that the Iraqi government carried out today, Tuesday, broad diplomatic reorganizations that included its two ambassadors to the United Nations (New York and Geneva), Nizar Hamdoun and Barazan Al-Takriti, President Saddam Hussein's half-brother.

The official explained to Agence France Presse, requesting that his name remain anonymous, that Said Al-Mousawi, who is an accredited diplomat to the United Nations, was appointed instead of Hamdoun in New York.

Mohammad Al-Douri, the former dean of the law school in Baghdad, was appointed to replace Barazan Ibrahim Al-Takriti. 

Sultan Al-Shawi became Iraq's Representative to the League of Arab Nations, succeeding Nabil Najm. Al-Shawi heads the Legislations Committee in the Iraqi National Congress (Parliament).
 
This reorganization move, which affected 25 diplomats abroad, is the first of this size since the Gulf War in 1991.
