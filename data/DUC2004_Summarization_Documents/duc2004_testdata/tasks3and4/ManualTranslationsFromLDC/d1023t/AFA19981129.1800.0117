(Accompanied with photo) &HT; Arrival of Barazan Al-Takriti in Amman

Amman 11-29 (AFP) - Former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva Barazan Al-Takriti, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother, arrived in Amman today, Sunday, coming from Switzerland.
 
Al-Takriti refused, in a brief statement to reporters at the airport, to disclose the designated time for his return to Iraq and denied that he had thought of applying for political asylum in Switzerland.

He said, "I will return to Iraq, and what does it concern you about the date for that," indicating that the rumors about his conversion to a dissenter was "an exaggeration by the media."
  
Al-Takriti, who was angered by reporters' questions about the existence of financial disagreements within the family of the Iraqi president, added, "There are no disagreements, and we are not a company to have financial disputes between us."

Barazan, who was wearing a black tie, explained that "my stay in Switzerland where I was an ambassador for my country to the United Nations ended tragically," in a reference to his sadness for his wife who died of cancer.

Barazan had obtained guarantees before departing Geneva to return to Switzerland to visit his children who remained there.

Barazan Al-Takriti has eight children including six who are continuing their studies in Switzerland. They filed, together with their mother, applications for residency that are still under review.

On the fifth of last August, Barazan, who assumed his post in Geneva in February 1989, notified the Swiss authorities that his mission would end at the end of that very month. 

Barazan had declared to the Saudi "Al-Sharq Al-Awsat" Newspaper his desire to stay in Switzerland for family reasons following his transfer to Baghdad as part of a diplomatic reorganization move ordered by the Iraqi president.

Iraq's mission to the United Nations in Geneva denied that Barazan Al-Takriti had dissented, as the Iraqi opposition inferred.

Press reports said that the Iraqi ambassador had been refusing to return to Iraq because of his bad relations with Oday, the Iraqi president's eldest son.
