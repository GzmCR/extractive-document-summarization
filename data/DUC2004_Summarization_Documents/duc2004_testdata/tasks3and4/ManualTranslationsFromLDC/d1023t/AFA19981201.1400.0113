Arrival of Barazan Al-Takriti in Baghdad Expected

Baghdad 12-1 (AFP) - The arrival in Baghdad of Barazan Al-Takriti, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother who was an Ambassador to the Untied Nations in Geneva, is expected where he is due to accept condolences for the death of his wife the day after tomorrow, Thursday.

Although the official media outlets did not talk about the return of Al-Takriti to Baghdad, black banners were raised today, Tuesday, in a number of Baghdad's residential areas indicating that he will, starting Thursday and for three days, receive condolences in the town of Aoujah, his birthplace in the Tikrit region.
  
According to the banners, Barazan Al-Takriti, whose images upon arrival in Amman were shown by Iraqi television, "Will receive condolences with his brothers in Aoujah," his birthplace located about 150 kilometers north of the Iraqi capital.

A Jordanian official had earlier announced that Al-Takriti crossed by car this morning the Al-Karama Border Center between Jordan and Iraq (330 kilometers to the east of Amman).
 
Al-Takriti's wife, Ahlam Khairallah Telfah, sister of the Iraqi president's wife, died in November of cancer, and she was buried in Aoujah.

In an interview published today by the Jordanian "Al Arab Al Youm" Newspaper, Al-Takriti denied press reports which said that he was thinking about not returning to Iraq.

He said, "I was, and still am, part of the political regime in Iraq as I have been an ambassador for Iraq for eleven years, and if I were in disagreement with the regime, it would have been illogical that I continued to be ambassador for Iraq for eleven years."

Al-Takriti added that he will ask the Iraqi president to relieve him of any responsibility "because I am now in a tragic family situation that does not allow me to perform even the minimum demanded by any position."

He had obtained guarantees before departing Geneva that he may return to Switzerland to visit his children who remained there.

Barazan, who was transferred to Baghdad as part of diplomatic reorganizations, declared recently that he wishes to stay in Switzerland for family reasons.
