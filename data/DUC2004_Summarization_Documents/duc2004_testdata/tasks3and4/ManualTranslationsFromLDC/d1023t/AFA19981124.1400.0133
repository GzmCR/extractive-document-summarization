Broad Diplomatic Reorganizations in Iraq

Baghdad 11-24 (AFP) - An Iraqi official announced that the Iraqi government carried out today, Tuesday, wide diplomatic reorganizations that included its two ambassadors to the United Nations (New York and Geneva), Nizar Hamdoun and Barazan Al-Takriti, President Saddam Hussein's half-brother.

The official explained to Agence France Presse, requesting that his name remain anonymous, that Said Al-Mousawi, who is an accredited diplomat to the United Nations, was appointed to instead of Hamdoun in New York.

Mohammad Al-Douri, the former dean of the law school in Baghdad, was appointed to replace Barazan Ibrahim Al-Takriti. 

Al-Takriti, who has occupied his post in Geneva since February 1989, maintains tense relations with Oday, Saddam Hussein's eldest son. Informed Iraqi sources said that he has not returned to Iraq since 1990, and he is concerned about his fate.

Iraqi sources in the region indicated in early October that Al-Takriti was summoned to Baghdad last July following a diplomatic reorganization, but he refused to return to Iraq.

Sultan Al-Shawi was appointed Iraq's Representative to the League of Arab Nations in Cairo, succeeding Nabil Najm, who assumed the post of Deputy Foreign Minister. 

Naji Al-Hudaithi, the former advisor at the Ministry of Information, was appointed Ambassador to Vienna and Iraq's Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Ghazi Al-Faisal was appointed head of the Iraqi Interests Section in the French capital with the rank of ambassador.

In turn, the Editor-in-Chief of Al Jumhoria Newspaper was appointed Ambassador of Iraq to India. The former Director of Radio and Television, Sabah Yassin, was appointed Ambassador to Amman, instead of Nouri Al-Wais, who was summoned to Baghdad.

The two deputies at the Foreign Ministry, Saad Abdel Majeed Al-Faisal and Abdel Al-Jabbar Al-Douri, were appointed ambassadors to Yemen and Morocco, consecutively.
  
The Iraqi official announced that the new ambassadors will join their posts within a month-and-a-half.

The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf, met today with the new ambassadors and briefed them "on the Iraqi diplomacy directives of escalating the move toward lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq and developing relations with various countries of the world."

This reorganization move, which affected 25 diplomats abroad, is the first of this size since the Gulf War in 1991.
