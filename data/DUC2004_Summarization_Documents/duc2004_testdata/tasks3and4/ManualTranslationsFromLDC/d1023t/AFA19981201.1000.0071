Barazan Al-Takriti Returns to Baghdad; Denies Existence of Any Disagreement with Saddam Hussein
 
Amman 12-1 (AFP) - Barazan Al-Takriti, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's half-brother, who left Amman by land today, Tuesday, heading to Baghdad, denied the existence of any disagreement with the Iraqi president.
 
A Jordanian official reported that Al-Takriti, who was his country's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, crossed by car this morning the Al-Karama Border Center between Jordan and Iraq (330 kilometers to the of east of Amman).

In an interview published today by the Jordanian "Al Arab Al Youm" Newspaper, Al-Takriti denied press reports which said that he was thinking about not returning to Iraq.

He said, "I was, and still am, part of the political regime in Iraq as I have been an ambassador for Iraq for eleven years, and if I were in disagreement with the regime, it would have been illogical that I continued to be ambassador for Iraq for eleven years."

Al-Takriti added that he will ask the Iraqi president to relieve him of any responsibility "because I am now in a tragic family situation that does not allow me to perform even the minimum demanded by any position."

Al-Takriti's wife, Ahlam Khairallah Telfah, sister of the Iraqi president's wife, had died in November of cancer.

Al-Takriti, who arrived last Sunday in Amman, said that "my kids (who remained in Switzerland) need me more than at any time before because of the absence of their mother, which makes my absence from them harder for them, but despite that, I decided to ignore my feelings and my kids' needs to have me next to them and decided to return to Baghdad immediately to put an end to this nonsense that hostile media outlets are spreading rumors about."

He had obtained a guarantee before departing Geneva that he may return to Switzerland to visit his children who remained there.

Al-Takriti, who was transferred to Baghdad as part of diplomatic reorganizations, declared recently that he wishes to stay in Switzerland for family reasons.

The Iraqi opposition affirmed that he had dissented, but Iraq's mission to the United Nations in Geneva denied these reports.

Press reports indicated that Al-Takriti had been refusing to return to Iraq because of his bad relations with Oday Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president's eldest son.

Barazan Al-Takriti's daughter, Suja, had taken refuge with her father shortly after her marriage to Oday because of the mistreatment she was receiving from him.

Sources close to Al-Takriti confirmed in August 1995 that he decided to flee Iraq, as did the Iraqi president's son-in-law Hussein Kamel Hassan who took refuge in Amman, which was also denied by Al-Takriti.

It should be noted that Hussein Kamel, Minister of Military Industrialization, returned to Baghdad six months after fleeing Iraq, and he was assassinated in February 1996.

On the other hand, Al-Takriti warned the United States from the consequences of her policy on Iraq and said, "We acknowledge and know that America is capable of igniting a fire anywhere, but is she capable of extinguishing it whenever she wants?, and is she able to limit the size of the fire to its place without spreading to the neighborhood?"

Iraq had avoided an American military strike in the middle of last November after Saddam Hussein decided at the last minute to resume cooperation with the United Nations disarmament inspectors.
