Palestinian Negotiator Criticizes Accord

Wye Plantation 10-23 (AFP) - Palestinian Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, one of the chief Palestinian negotiators, criticized the accord that was reached at dawn today, Friday, at Wye Plantation.
  
Abed Rabbo, who was one of the Palestinian negotiators in the final round of negotiations for 17 hours last night, said that the accord "was much less than required."

He warned that the accord encompasses "many deficiencies and gaps" and added, "I do not have the least confidence that the Israelis would respect and implement the accord."
