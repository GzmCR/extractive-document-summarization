Clinton Sets Tuesday as Deadline for Reaching Agreement between Israelis and Palestinians

Wye Mills (United States) 10-16 (AFP) - A high-level Palestinian official announced today, Friday, that American President Bill Clinton gave the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who are meeting at Wye Plantation (Maryland) until next Tuesday to reach "an agreement."

The official, who asked to remain anonymous, explained that Clinton gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat "until Tuesday to reach an agreement and stressed that it will be either a total failure or a total success, and that there is no postponement to any issues and no half-solutions for them either."
  
The source added that the American president said, "We waited 17 months and it is time to sign an agreement. We know that you have domestic problems as we have many international concerns, and we will not be able to continue the intense efforts we exerted so far."

The official indicated that Clinton told the two sides that in the event no agreement is reached, he will announce it, apparently in an attempt to pressure the two sides, especially the Israeli side.
