Moscow Contends Striking Iraq Will Destroy Seven Years of Diplomacy

Moscow 11-11 (AFP) - The Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, warned today, Wednesday, against using force against Iraq, which will destroy, according to him, seven years of difficult diplomatic work and will complicate the regional situation in the area.
  
Ivanov contended that carrying out air strikes against Iraq, who refuses to cooperate with the United Nations inspectors, "will end the tremendous work achieved by the international group during the past seven years and will complicate the situation in the region."
 
Nevertheless, Ivanov stressed that Baghdad must resume working with the Special Commission in charge of disarming the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM).
