Tony Blair: Britain Still "Ready to Strike" Iraq

London 11-15 (AFP) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair said today, Sunday, that the crisis between the international community and Iraq "did not end" and that Britain is still "ready, prepared, and able to strike Iraq."
  
In a gathering with the press held at the Prime Minister's office, Blair contended that the crisis with Iraq "will not end until Iraq has absolutely and unconditionally respected its commitments" towards the United Nations.

A spokesman for Tony Blair had indicated that the British Prime Minister gave permission to British Air Force Tornado planes stationed in Kuwait to join the aerial bombardment against Iraq. The operation was suspended after Iraq declared its readiness to resume its cooperation with the United Nations inspectors in charge of disarming it.

Several American media outlets confirmed that American B-52 fighters were on their way yesterday, Saturday, to Baghdad when Iraq announced its above-mentioned decision.
