Saudi Arabia Unhappy About Iraq's Intransigence

Riyadh 11-8 (AFP) - An official Saudi source announced that Saudi Arabia is unhappy about the intransigent position taken by Iraq towards the United Nations inspectors and holds her responsible for the consequences arising out of such a position.

The source said, "Diffusing the crisis instigated by Iraq lies on the shoulder of the Iraqi government itself, which has to take into consideration the suffering of the Iraqi people and nation and avert any harm upon them."

The same source expressed Saudi Arabia's "unhappiness and astonishment" for Iraq's decision to sever its relations with the United Nations inspectors, especially that it came "at a time when the Security Council expressed its preparedness to conduct a comprehensive review of the sanctions imposed against Iraq, something Iraq has been demanding."

The official Saudi source indicated that Saudi Arabia's position "will remain committed to resolving the new crisis, which was instigated by the Iraqi government with the Security Council, via diplomatic means that include Iraq's implementation of and respect for the agreement signed by the Iraqi government with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan" last February.

In response to a question on whether Saudi Arabia supports carrying out a military strike against Iraq, the Saudi official said, "No discussion is taking place on the military option but only on the various options that must be considered in order to assure Iraq's commitment to implementing Security Council resolutions."
