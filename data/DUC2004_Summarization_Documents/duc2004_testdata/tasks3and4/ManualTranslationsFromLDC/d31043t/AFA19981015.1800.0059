United States Congratulates New Lebanese President

Beirut 10-15 (AFP) - The United States congratulated General Emile Lahoud, who was elected by the Parliament today, Thursday, as president of the Lebanese republic.

In a statement, which Agence France Presse received a copy of, a spokesman for the American Department of State, James Rubin, said that the United States received with relief the election of the Army Commander as president of Lebanon.
   
Rubin added, "The elected president is credited with re-building the Lebanese armed forces after the civil war, and now he is need of the same energy and same determination to build and consolidate the state institutions and continue with the reconstruction and national reconciliation process."
 
The Lebanese Parliament elected today, Thursday, Army Commander General Emile Lahoud without any surprise, as president of the republic, 10 days after his selection by Syria, who dominates the political scene in Lebanon.

General Lahoud is the country's third president after the Taif National Reconciliation Agreement (1989) and the tenth since Lebanon's independence in the year 1943.  He is the second Army Commander to ascend to the presidency after General Fouad Chehab (1958-1964).
