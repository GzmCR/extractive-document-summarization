Druze Leader Walid Junblatt Boycotts General Lahoud's Election Session
 
Beirut 10-7 (AFP) - The President of the Progressive Socialist Party, Druze leader Walid Junblatt, confirmed today, Wednesday, his boycott and that of his party's representatives of the election session of General Emile Lahoud for president of the republic, and criticized the way Lahoud was selected to assume the presidency.
   
Junblatt said following his meeting with the president of the republic, Elias Al-Hrawi, "Historically, we do not approve for a military man to take control of the country and even if he took off his military uniform to turn up as a civilian." 

He added: "No one can force the Progressive Socialist Party and force Walid Junblatt to cast his vote without conviction."
 
It is to be mentioned that the selection of the army commander for the presidency of the republic was settled in Damascus on Monday during a summit between Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and Al-Hrawi whose term ends next November 23.  

Junblatt expressed his dissatisfaction for the way General Lahoud was selected and said: "Matters were supposed to be conducted in a more democratic way.  In Lebanon, there are political diversity and fierce competition and these principles were not respected."

Junblatt, who is one of the most distinguished war militia leaders in Lebanon and one of the leaders of the Druze faction (about 300 thousand people), said, "In order that there is no confrontation in the beginning, I will not attend the cabinet meeting, which will propose amending the constitution (to allow Lahoud's election) tomorrow, Thursday, and we will also not attend the election session" that will be convened by the Parliament most likely next week.

Junblatt affirmed that he and two other party representatives will boycott the election session, which is expected to be convened by the Parliament next Thursday, indicating that he left the freedom to decide to various representatives from the Parliamentary bloc that he heads, the National Struggle Front (11 representatives), because they do not belong to the Progressive Socialist Party.

It is to be mentioned that the Parliament (128 representatives split in half between Christians and Moslems) elects the president of the republic by absolute majority.

On the other hand, Junblatt confirmed that he announced earlier the possibility of nominating himself for the presidency of the republic "as an intercepting plan", and added: "You know that we are second-class citizens and even third."

It is to be pointed out that the president of the republic is elected from followers of the Maronite faction, Lebanon's largest Christian faction, as part of an implied agreement (norm) that is still in effect since independence despite the reforms ratified by the Taif Conference in 1989.
