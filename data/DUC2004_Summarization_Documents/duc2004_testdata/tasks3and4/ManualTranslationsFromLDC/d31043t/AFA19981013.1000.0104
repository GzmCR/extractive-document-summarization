Lebanese Parliament Elects General Lahoud President of Republic Thursday

Beirut 10-13 (AFP) - The Office of the Speaker of the Parliament called on the General Assembly today, Tuesday, to convene after tomorrow, Thursday, to elect the current Army Commander General Emile Lahoud president of the republic.

A statement issued by the council's Speaker office explained that an invitation has been extended to the representatives (128 representatives) after the constitutional amendment law was published in a special supplement of the official gazette. 

The constitution state that winning the presidency requires that the candidate obtain a two-third majority of the Parliamentary votes in the first round and an absolute majority (half + 1) in subsequent rounds.

The Parliament had earlier passed before noon today, Tuesday, by a majority of 113 votes, an amendment to Article 49 of the constitution "as a one-time exception" in order for it to elect General Lahoud, whose selection was agreed upon in a Lebanese-Syrian summit held on the fifth of October in Damascus.

Four representatives opposed the amendment in the Parliamentary Council, while 11 representatives did not attend the session, including 9 representatives from the National Struggle Bloc headed by the Immigrants Minister, Druze leader Walid Junblatt, who had earlier announced his opposition to the ascension to the presidency by a military man.

The government, at the request of the President of the Republic, Elias Al-Hrawi, had sent to the Parliamentary Council last Thursday a constitutional bill calling for amending Article 49, which calls for first-grade employees to submit their resignations two years before being nominated for the presidency post.

The amendment, passed by the council, requires the addition of a paragraph to the above-mentioned article stating the following: "As a one-time exception, the president of the republic may be elected from among judges or first-grade employees, or their counterparts in all public administrations and public corporations as well as all individuals subject to common law."
