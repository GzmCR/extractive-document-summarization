Damascus: Israel Wants to "Impede Stride" of Lahoud and Syria Will Give Him All Support

Damascus 11-28 (AFP) - An official Syrian newspaper accused Israel today, Saturday, of seeking to "impede the stride" of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and to prevent him from "implementing his political strategy". Syria affirmed that she would give all she has to support Lebanon and that no one "can hamper the steps" of Lahoud in his "national task."
  
"Al Thawra" newspaper wrote that "hardly five days have passed since the comprehensive address was delivered by President Lahoud when Israeli threats against Lebanon started; threats that are ripe with audacity and defiance of the world and its resolutions, and they disregard all norms.

The paper said that "it is not possible to isolate this serious escalation of the situation from President Lahoud's policy and statement for the purpose of impeding his stride, and slowing down his thrust for starting to implement his political strategy."
  
"Al Thawra" added, "Lahoud is well aware of that and realizes that Israeli challenges have never stopped for one moment," and that escalation "will not hamper him from undertaking his national duties, relying on the support of all of Lebanon with all of its factions, as well as on the full support of Syria in order to achieve his national tasks and deliver on his commitments.

The paper pointed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's interruption of his visit to Britain, and "his declaration of changing his strategy and tactic in Lebanon with a new style of dealing," and indicated that "his Defense Minister threw in his share of threats of aggression," using, as usual, "resistance operations in the south as a pretext for threatening and aggression."
 
"Al Thawra" affirmed that Lahoud "will always have in Syria and President Hafez Al Assad as backers and supporters who will give all they have to support Lebanon regardless of the sacrifices, that the Israeli threats will fail as others did before, and that no one can hamper the Lebanese president or impede his strides in his honorable national task."
