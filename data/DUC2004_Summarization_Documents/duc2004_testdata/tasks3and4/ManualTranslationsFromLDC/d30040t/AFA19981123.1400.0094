(Accompanied with photo) &HT; By Sakhr Abu Al Aon &HT; Arafat Inaugurates Gaza International Airport Tomorrow by Receiving Eight Arab and Foreign Planes

Gaza 11-23 (AFP) - Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will officially inaugurate the Gaza International Airport tomorrow morning, Tuesday, by receiving, at eight-thirty local time (6:30 GMT) an Egyptian plane, the first of eight Arab and foreign planes that will land at the airport tomorrow.

Arafat will welcome the delegates in the VIP lounge before he hosts them in the evening at a dinner party.

Following the Egyptian plane will be a Moroccan plane, then a Jordanian plane, then three Spanish planes, then a plane belonging to the Palestinian Airlines that was donated by the Saudi prince, Al Walid Bin Talal, and finally the Palestinian presidential plane that was until now using the near-by Egyptian airport of Al Arish.
 
The inauguration of the airport will be a landmark of sovereignty that will be added to the Palestinian Authority's credit and Palestine's gateway to the outside world.

Gaza Airport, whose construction began in 1995 near the Egyptian borders on an area of 2300 acres, encompasses a passenger terminal, a runway, a cargo section, a VIP lounge and a building for Palestinian Airlines, all of which were designed according to an Islamic architectural style inspired from old Arab Jerusalem's buildings.

Construction costs of the airport have reached 70 million dollars so far, of which the Palestinian Authority contributed 16 million. The Palestinian Authority obtained a loan for 18 million dollars from the Egyptian Ahli Bank and the Egyptian Arab Realty Bank, followed by an additional sum of 20 million dollars provided by Spain and 15 million dollars from Germany, given in the form of tools and equipment.
  
The airport was designed in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) standards, equally those dealing with the runway's length and width or with navigation equipment. The runway is capable of receiving giant planes of Boeing 74-7 model. It received Arafat's plane in June 1996, as a test, followed by a Moroccan plane carrying medical supplies in the same month. 

Airport operation crews have been ready after 172 Palestinian cadres were trained in the Kingdom of Morocco's airports. The number of those working at the airport is 400 employees.

Gaza Airport is ready for day operation, and efforts are underway to operate it at night also, but the special technical equipment dealing with night aviation is still at the Israeli port of Ashdod or at Spanish or German ports because the Israelis refused to allow its entry and assembly before signing the airport operation protocol. The airport is expected to receive about 700 thousand passengers annually.
 
The Palestinian Authority preceded the start of constructing the airport by establishing "the Palestinian Airlines Company" which owns two "Fokker 5-0" planes donated by Holland and a "Boeing 72-7" plane given by the Saudi prince, Al Walid Bin Talal.

The airport will practically begin operation in a week. For two months, passport, personal identification cards and luggage checks will take place at the nearby Rafah land crossing point, then passengers will be transported in special buses to planes, until the terminal that will be shared with the Israeli side dealing with security checks is completed.
 
Gaza Airport is included in the first phase of the Wye River Accord, the implementation of which started last Friday with a partial Israeli withdrawal from some of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank.
