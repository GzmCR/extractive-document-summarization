First Palestinian Commercial Flight from Gaza International Airport Leaves Late

Rafah (Gaza Strip) 12-5 (AFP) - The first Palestinian commercial flight took off from Gaza International Airport today, Saturday, more than four hours late from its official schedule, because of disagreements between the Israelis and Palestinians on security checks procedures.

Agence France Presse's correspondent said that a "Fokker-5-0" plane belonging to the Palestinian Airlines left Gaza International Airport heading to the Jordanian capital, Amman, carrying aboard 45 passengers holding Palestinian and Jordanian passports, in addition to a Canadian citizen.
 
Passengers were transported three kilometers to Rafah land crossing point in special buses where Israelis checked their passports before they returned to the airport to board the plane.
