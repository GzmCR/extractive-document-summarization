Anan in Algeria Repeating Tour Devoted to Western Sahara with Possibility of  Stopping in Libya

Algeria 11-29 (AFP) - United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Anan, arrived this evening, Sunday, in Algeria, repeating a tour in North Africa, that might also include Libya, devoted to the conflict in the Western Sahara, to sign an agreement on the Lockerbie case.
 
Anan had interrupted his tour on November 11 after he visited Mauritania, Western Sahara and Morocco, when he had to go back to New York because of the last crisis between Iraq and the United Nations.

Anan arrived in Algeria from Paris where he participated in the twentieth African-French summit, which was convened on Friday and Saturday in the French capital.
  
He is scheduled to visit Saharan refugee camps in Tindof (in southwestern Algeria) to hold meetings with leaders of the Polasario Front. 

Anan will spend the first and second of next December in the Algerian capital where he will conduct a series of talks with the Algerian leaders, after which he will go to Tunisia to pay an official visit on the third and fourth of December.

Anan is seeking the agreement of Morocco and Polasario on a series of proposals aiming at holding a referendum on the future of Western Sahara in December 1999.

In New York, Fred Eckhard, Anan's spokesman, said the latter may repeat his tour "with confidence" but without being "optimistic."

Nevertheless, Anan's tour may include Libya in the event an agreement with the Libyan leader Moammar Al Kaddafy is guaranteed to hand over two Libyans accused of blowing up an American civilian plane over Lockerbie in Scotland (270 dead in 1988).
  
In the event such an agreement is concluded, it will put an end to six years of confrontation between Libya and the International Security Council, which imposed an embargo in many forms on Libya in 1992 to force her to cooperate in the Lockerbie case.  Nevertheless, some of Libya's African neighbors are openly violating this embargo.
   
In a statement released a few days ago, Anan expressed hope for reaching an agreement over Lockerbie "by the end of this month."
 
He said, "I will be in the area next week, and the question is out there to determine if my going (to Libya) is useful thus ending this matter." He added, "I have not yet decided (to visit Libya), but that is not ruled out."
