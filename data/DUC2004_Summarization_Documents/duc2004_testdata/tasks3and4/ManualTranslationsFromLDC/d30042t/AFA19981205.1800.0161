Kofi Anan Leaves Libya Heading to Tunisia

Tripoli 12-5 (AFP) - United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Anan, left Tripoli this evening, Saturday, heading to Tunisia following a closed meeting with the Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy in the Libyan desert that lasted one and a half hours.

Anan had announced in a press conference he held in Tripoli earlier that no final agreement was reached with Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy on the Lockerbie case.

He said, "This will take additional time," adding that he "prefers not to give additional details at this stage."

Nevertheless, the Libyan Foreign Minister, Omar Al Montasser, described his talks with Anan during the same press conference as being very positive. He said, "We held very positive and clear talks."

In responding to a question whether the General Popular Congress (Libyan Parliament), which will convene next Tuesday's session in Sart in East Tripoli, will discuss a possible agreement on the Lockerbie case, Al Montasser replied, "The Popular Congress will hold an annual meeting next Tuesday, and it will discuss all Libyan internal and external political issues."
