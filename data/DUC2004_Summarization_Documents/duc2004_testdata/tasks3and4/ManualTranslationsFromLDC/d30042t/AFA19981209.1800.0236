Libya Announces New Round of Negotiations with United Nations over Lockerbie

Sart (Libya) 12-9 (AFP) - Libyan Justice Minister, Mohammad Abu Al Kasem Al Zawi, announced today, Wednesday, that a new round of negotiations will be held between the Libyan legal team and officials from the United Nations on the Lockerbie issue, but he did not specify a date for it.

The Libyan minister said before the General Popular Congress (Parliament), which commenced its meetings in Sart yesterday, Tuesday, and which are carried live on the air by Libyan television, "Some clarifications came from the United States, Britain and Holland."
 
He added, "Yet, there are some points that need more discussion with the appropriate parties."

He went on to say, "Preparations are underway for a new round of talks between the Libyan legal team and the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General for Legal Affairs (Hans Corel)."

Libya had agreed last August to try the two individuals accused in the Lockerbie incident in 1988 (270 dead) in Holland and in accordance with Scottish law, but Libya is demanding additional guarantees dealing especially with the venue of detention in the event they are convicted.
