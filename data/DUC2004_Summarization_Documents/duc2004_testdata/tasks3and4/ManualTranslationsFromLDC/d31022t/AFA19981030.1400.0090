Swedish Police: No Indications Fire in Gutenberg Disco Was Deliberate

Stockholm 10-30 (AFP) - An official of the Swedish judiciary police announced that police do not have any elements that indicate that the fire inside a disco in Gutenberg (southwest) that resulted in killing at least 60 teenagers was deliberate.
 
Officer Hans Carlssen said in a press conference held at the scene of the fire that the investigation elements indicate, on the other hand, that the fire, which also resulted in wounding 190 people, is the result of an accident.

The spokesman for the rescue authorities, Linart Ohlin, had announced this morning, Friday, that the fire may have been deliberate, and confirmed to the Swedish News Agency, "TT", that there are "some indications that lead to the belief that the fire may have been deliberate."
 
He explained that the flames were still raging at the scene when firefighting crews just arrived, a few minutes after the alarm was sounded, stressing that it is "impossible for the flames to have spread that quickly."

The man in charge of the rescue crews, Peter Severstedt, said that "the fire broke out after an explosion."

Gutenberg police, in responding to Agence France Presse's questions, refused to immediately confirm these statements. They explained, "At the present time, we do not have any information that is specific enough to confirm that the fire was deliberate. We are listening to statements from the young people who were present in the disco."
