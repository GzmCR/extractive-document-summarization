South African Vice President Criticizes Publication of Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Report
 
The Cape 10-29 (AFP) - The South African Vice President, Tabo Mabiki, criticized today, Thursday, the decision of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to publish its report without taking into consideration the objections of the ruling African National Congress.
    
Mabiki, who is also the President of the African National Congress, told reporters that "that does not help the process for which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established."

Mabiki, who was appointed as President Nelson Mandela's successor to head the party, announced that the African National Congress is awaiting the text of the judgment issued by the Supreme Court in The Cape this morning, Thursday, to determine how to manage the dispute between the African National Congress and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

The Supreme Court in The Cape had rejected this morning, Thursday, a request by the African National Congress to ban the publication of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report.
 
The African National Congress, President Nelson Mandela's party, requested banning the publication of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report, arguing that the Commission did not give it the opportunity to respond to what was in the document "which incriminates all struggle for liberation" during the apartheid regime.
